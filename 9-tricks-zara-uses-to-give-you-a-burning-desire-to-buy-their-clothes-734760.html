Today, the annual revenue of&nbsp;the company is&nbsp;measured in&nbsp;<a href=#>billions</a> of&nbsp;dollars. And it’s&nbsp;us, the customers, who spend this crazy amount of&nbsp;money in&nbsp;Zara. Have you ever thought about what makes people want to&nbsp;get new clothes over and over again?</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong> has analyzed the marketing strategy of&nbsp;this brand and identified several tricks it&nbsp;uses to&nbsp;“capture” its customers.</p><p><h2>1. The most expensive clothes are located at&nbsp;the entrance&nbsp;— this is&nbsp;how they capture your attention.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eae/a6f/f12efb50dc9a99ab86348a025f.jpg><p>In&nbsp;Zara stores, clothing is&nbsp;arranged according to&nbsp;the price. At&nbsp;the <a href=#>entrance</a>, there are the most expensive clothes. The designers hope that their customers will fall in&nbsp;love with these clothes right away. Ideally, you are not supposed to&nbsp;make it&nbsp;to&nbsp;the rows with the cheaper clothes. Zara is&nbsp;betting on&nbsp;the fact that you will make a&nbsp;decision impulsively: see&nbsp;— want&nbsp;— buy.</p><p>The farthest parts of&nbsp;the store are for the customers looking for cheaper clothes. There, you can find basic clothes and clothes that have been discounted. But while you are on&nbsp;your way to&nbsp;the inside of&nbsp;the store, you might already see a&nbsp;dress, a&nbsp;handbag, and some shoes from the new collection that you want.</p><p><h2>2. Clothes, shoes, and handbags are placed adjacent to&nbsp;each other for a&nbsp;reason.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/af9/756/e32b025070b113dcc87e1264c4.jpg><p>There are no&nbsp;<a href=#>departments</a> in&nbsp;Zara stores, at&nbsp;least not in&nbsp;the sense we&nbsp;are used&nbsp;to. Clothes, handbags, shoes, and accessories are all located in&nbsp;the same area. You don’t have to&nbsp;think about which shoes go&nbsp;with which dress. The store designers have already decided this for you.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, this capsule approach is&nbsp;very convenient. It&nbsp;saves you a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time and helps you find your way in&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;ever-changing trends. But this is&nbsp;also a&nbsp;cunning trick: a&nbsp;customer’s logical thinking shuts down because everything has already been decided for them. The only thing they have to&nbsp;do&nbsp;is&nbsp;pay.</p><p><h2>3. Zara doesn’t have any commercials and it’s not because they want to&nbsp;save money.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/612/5f9/f0808851feae4cca639a792739.jpg><p>Zara spends a&nbsp;ridiculously low, <a href=#>0.3% of&nbsp;their profit, </a>on&nbsp;advertising. The brand doesn’t go&nbsp;out and talk about how great, trendy, and comfortable it&nbsp;is&nbsp;on&nbsp;purpose. But this is&nbsp;not some kind of&nbsp;marketing mistake, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;well-thought out strategy to&nbsp;make you spend more conquer the market.</p><p>Zara invests its money into catalogs... and window signage. Their tactic makes customers start to&nbsp;feel that there is&nbsp;something exclusive inside their stores. They think that the quality of&nbsp;their clothes is&nbsp;so&nbsp;good, that it&nbsp;doesn’t even need any promotion. Think of&nbsp;it&nbsp;this way, Balenciaga and Versace don’t have any&nbsp;TV commercials, but everyone knows that they are premium brands.</p><p>The same trick works for Zara: you come to&nbsp;their store to&nbsp;buy a&nbsp;thing that your colleague/friend/neighbor doesn’t have. They offer exclusive clothes for very little money. Of&nbsp;course, there is&nbsp;nothing exclusive about&nbsp;it, it’s just that Zara exploits our craving for something special and we&nbsp;don’t mind&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>4. The brand has a&nbsp;subconscious influence on&nbsp;you: it&nbsp;makes you feel as&nbsp;if&nbsp;you are part of&nbsp;the elite.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1ed/d9b/2e33c95862912240cca254c745.jpg><p>Zara will never open a&nbsp;store next to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Walmart, Auchan, or&nbsp;some other supermarket. The brand pays a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;attention to&nbsp;the location of&nbsp;their stores. The stores are opened only in&nbsp;big shopping malls or&nbsp;on&nbsp;the main streets of&nbsp;big cities.</p><p>Look carefully: there is&nbsp;almost always some elite branded store next to&nbsp;a&nbsp;Zara store. Of&nbsp;course, they have stylish and beautiful clothes, but they are way too expensive. And Zara is&nbsp;different: by&nbsp;placing their stores next to&nbsp;elite boutiques, they say, “Our clothes are also stylish.” But the average price in&nbsp;Zara is&nbsp;much lower. In&nbsp;other words, Zara gives you the chance to&nbsp;feel as&nbsp;stylish as&nbsp;the people who spend a&nbsp;fortune on&nbsp;their clothes.</p><p>By&nbsp;the way, <a href=# title="Kate Middleton" data-link=tag>Kate Middleton</a> helped the brand become a&nbsp;little more aristocratic. The Duchess is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;Zara: right after her wedding, Kate put on&nbsp;a&nbsp;simple blue Zara dress and of&nbsp;course, it&nbsp;became a&nbsp;hit immediately.</p><p><h2>5. Zara releases several new collections per season on&nbsp;purpose.</h2></p><p class=adme-img-description>More than 400 designers work on&nbsp;creating new collections.</p><p>Zara’s strategy is&nbsp;fast fashion with a&nbsp;short shelf-life. The brand has changed our attitude toward clothes. Now, there is&nbsp;nothing special about shopping: you buy clothes and then you just get rid of&nbsp;them, just like when you throw old food away.</p><p>While other brands are playing a&nbsp;guessing game with the trends of&nbsp;the upcoming seasons, Zara is&nbsp;releasing several new collections. Every couple of&nbsp;months, these trends change and the brand releases a&nbsp;series of&nbsp;new clothes again. If&nbsp;something trendy appeared on&nbsp;a&nbsp;runway, a&nbsp;city street, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;celebrities, be&nbsp;sure that, soon enough, you will see it&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;Zara store.</p><p>However, this is&nbsp;also the biggest disadvantage: customers get addicted to&nbsp;fast fashion. Zara produces <a href=#>450 million</a> things per year and everyone can find something they like. They make&nbsp;us think that new clothes can make&nbsp;us happy and stylish. And if&nbsp;they don’t, you can always go&nbsp;back to&nbsp;the store and try something else.</p><p><h2>6. You can be&nbsp;sold a&nbsp;piece of&nbsp;clothing that wasn’t sold in&nbsp;a&nbsp;different part of&nbsp;the world.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9b2/7a2/9159a258929f74a763542852b0.jpg><p>Zara clothes do&nbsp;more <a href=#>traveling</a> than some people&nbsp;do. And this is&nbsp;because the clothes that are not sold well in&nbsp;one store travel to&nbsp;the others. Skirts, pants, and T-shirts just travel around the world: some clothes from Europe might even end up&nbsp;in&nbsp;Russian stores.</p><p>But if&nbsp;a&nbsp;model was not very successful, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;redesigned. So, some parts of&nbsp;less successful outfits get a&nbsp;new life. Zara knows how to&nbsp;save its money and doesn’t just get rid of&nbsp;its unsold clothes.</p><p><h2>7. The brand creates the illusion of&nbsp;scarcity to&nbsp;make you buy at&nbsp;least something.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/fc4/c9b/f4df2852da9a3beee9895dc713.jpg><p>Zara creates the <a href=#>scarcity effect</a>. Basically, they want your brain to&nbsp;go, “If&nbsp;you miss the chance to&nbsp;buy this thing now, you will never see it&nbsp;again.” It&nbsp;means that you “think” a&nbsp;jacket that you saw in&nbsp;a&nbsp;store 10&nbsp;days ago could disappear from the shelves and never appear there again.</p><p>Creating this feeling for their customers puts them in&nbsp;a&nbsp;hamster mindset: they stock up&nbsp;for the future and buy clothes in&nbsp;advance. And the brain gets the impulse to&nbsp;“Get this thing NOW!” Impulsive purchases are good for the seller, but bad for the customer. In&nbsp;the end, most of&nbsp;us end up&nbsp;<a href=#>regretting</a> the money we&nbsp;spent.</p><p><h2>8. Their sales work in&nbsp;a&nbsp;special way.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/6bd/3ee/5483ae5f8cad27ea420bbfac1c.jpg><p>Before the start of&nbsp;the sale season (usually in&nbsp;July, August, December, January, and February), Zara tries to&nbsp;sell as&nbsp;many clothes as&nbsp;possible at&nbsp;their regular price. The stores are full of&nbsp;clothes from the old collection, and the newer models will be&nbsp;hard to&nbsp;find. The clothes from the new collection will have special tags on&nbsp;them, and the rest of&nbsp;the clothes are the “old” ones. But a&nbsp;few days later, they will be&nbsp;sold at&nbsp;a&nbsp;much lower price. Just wait for a&nbsp;little while and you won’t have to&nbsp;regret spending more money in&nbsp;vain.</p><p>Even the Zara store retail associates <a href=#>don’t recommend</a> buying clothes from old collections right before sales.</p><p><h2>9. Zara has special stores where there will never be&nbsp;any customers.</h2></p><p class=adme-img-description>A&nbsp;test store at&nbsp;the Zara headquarters</p><p>Zara has stores that will never be&nbsp;visited by&nbsp;regular customers. The <a href=#>test stores</a> are hidden in&nbsp;the Spanish headquarters. If&nbsp;you’ve visited Zara in&nbsp;different countries, you’ve probably noticed that the interior design in&nbsp;them is&nbsp;pretty similar. A&nbsp;team of&nbsp;30&nbsp;architects thinks through every detail: the light bulb color and even the floor texture that is&nbsp;supposed to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;positive influence on&nbsp;customers.</p><p>By&nbsp;experimenting in&nbsp;the test stores, designers choose the optimal height of&nbsp;the hangers, the height of&nbsp;the mannequins, and the location of&nbsp;cash registers. All of&nbsp;this is&nbsp;done to&nbsp;help you feel more relaxed and prone to&nbsp;buy more.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;girl who worked for ZARA talked about how to&nbsp;get clothes at&nbsp;very cheap prices.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d86/b28/178dea50849f7aa0cab4d869db.jpg><p>We&nbsp;have found some tips from the employees of&nbsp;the store who’ve shared some of&nbsp;their insights. Now, you will also know how to&nbsp;save money on&nbsp;buying clothes from Zara if&nbsp;you were not able to&nbsp;resist the charm of&nbsp;this brand.</p><ul><li>Just like most clothing stores, the sales here happen 3&nbsp;times a&nbsp;year: at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the summer, before the New Year, and at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the winter.</li><li><a href=#>The lowest prices</a> during the sales are during the third week. On&nbsp;the first week, the discount is&nbsp;20-25%, on&nbsp;the second, it’s 40-50%, and by&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;the 3rd week, the prices drop by&nbsp;70-75%.</li><li><a href=#>Buy</a> the most trendy things at&nbsp;Zara and get your basic clothes at&nbsp;other stores. According to&nbsp;experienced customers, jeans and basic clothes from Zara aren’t the best quality.</li><li>Don’t buy shoes from the new collection right away. During the sale period, they will be&nbsp;back with a&nbsp;50% discount.</li><li>The stores have the bulk of&nbsp;their stock on&nbsp;Mondays: your chances of&nbsp;buying high-quality and cheap clothes are higher at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;the week.</li><li>The lowest prices for Zara clothes are in&nbsp;Spain and Portugal (a&nbsp;significant part of&nbsp;the clothes are made here). Are you going on&nbsp;a&nbsp;trip? Get another suitcase for your clothes!</li></ul><p>We&nbsp;admit that it’s sometimes extremely hard to&nbsp;not buy something impulsively. But this information made&nbsp;us think: do&nbsp;we&nbsp;really need a&nbsp;third pair of&nbsp;pants or&nbsp;another dress? Tell&nbsp;us about your experience with buying trendy clothes? Are you able to&nbsp;control yourself and to&nbsp;not buy something new even when you really want&nbsp;to?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZIZuwNGimqSrXa%2Bus62Mrqqeq12pvG6zyK%2BcZrGfqnqiecGuqaehnpx6pbHSoqmeZaSkeqPB2GaroZ2Zp3qkuM6tn56rXWyAdYOVaWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
