We‚Äôre going through a really hard time, okay? We are currently separated,‚Äù Umansky said. ‚ÄúWe are not talking about divorce, and we‚Äôre trying to deal with this stuff internally, privately.‚Äù</p><p>While some fans speculated that Umansky was dating real estate agent Leslie Bega, a representative for Bega clarified that the two were just friends.
