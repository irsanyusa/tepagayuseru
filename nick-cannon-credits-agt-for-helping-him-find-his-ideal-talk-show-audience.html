A big reason why he decided to do a daytime program has a lot to do with his past experience hosting <a href=#>America’s Got Talent</a>. He revealed how the NBC competition show helped him find his ideal audience in a new teaser.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-nick-cannon-reveals-why-he-decided-to-do-a-daytime-talk-show>Nick Cannon Reveals Why He Decided to Do a Daytime Talk Show</h2><p>“I’m excited about daytime just because I feel like I found my audience,” Cannon said in the trailer. “Having that ability to connect with the everyday person, I have so much inside of me and so much passion to connect with my people. Whether it’s from AGT and going across America, I had no better feeling connecting with that daytime audience.”</p><p>Cannon<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> left AGT in 2017</a> after NBC executives were unhappy with jokes he made in a Showtime comedy special. He has served as the host of The Masked Singer since its first season in 2019. Cannon realized he wanted to start his own talk show after guest-hosting <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>The Wendy Williams Show</a>.</p><p>Williams took a break from the show in 2019 to focus on her well-being. She recruited Cannon and a list of other celebrities to step in for her. Cannon did a great job and clearly enjoyed the energy that he got from the crowd. For his own talk show, he said that his demographic ranges “from the preschools to the old folks home.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CThcGYINaUk/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-trailer-reveals-a-familiar-celebrity-talk-show-guest>The Trailer Reveals a Familiar Celebrity Talk Show Guest</h2><p>In July, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reports began swirling</a> that Cannon was having a hard time booking talk show guests. After making <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-Semitic remarks</a> on his radio show, an insider revealed that publicists were wary about booking their clients on the show. Fortunately for Cannon, he has strengthened quite a few friendships from his time hosting The Masked Singer.</p><p>The Masked Singer Season 2 winner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wayne Brady</a> will appear virtually on the talk show. Cannon will confront Brady about his unique quarantine arrangement amid the pandemic. He had been quarantining with his ex-wife, Mandie Taketa, and her boyfriend, Jason Fordham, at the time. Their 18-year-old daughter was also staying in the house with them.</p><p>“I love my exes too Wayne, but not that much,” Cannon joked.</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">father of seven</a> has quite a few <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">celebrity exes</a> including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mariah Carey</a>, the mother of his 10-year-old twins, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Monroe and Moroccan</a>. Cannon has always been able to poke fun at himself and make jokes about his complicated love life. It definitely looks like Cannon’s show will be all about embracing who he is and showing that he can be fun and carefree at times too.</p><p>“We won’t be able to grow if we can’t have conversations about the things that make us different,” Cannon added. “Everyone is different and that’s a beautiful thing.”</p><p>Nick Cannon will air on Sept. 27 on Fox.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/GettyImages-1210668181.jpeg alt="‘X Factor’ Winner James Arthur Shuts Down Body-Shamers After Charity Soccer Match" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Nick Cannon</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zaKapGWTlruvu81mmqudlJ7BtHnAoKtmnp%2Bneqmxy6mgp59dnbauecWipZ1lmJ7AbrXDnpilZaSWuax50qGmsGWRqrGqsc2cnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
