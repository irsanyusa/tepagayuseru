However, there’s much more to Harry than his reality TV fame. Let’s take a closer look at this rising star’s journey from reality television heartthrob to DWTS sensation.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-is-harry-jowsey>Who is Harry Jowsey?</h2><p>Harry catapulted to fame in 2020 as a cast member of Too Hot to Handle, a reality dating show on Netflix. With his distinctive personality and undeniable charisma, he quickly became a fan favorite.</p><p>Since his breakout role on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>, Harry has been on a remarkable journey. His magnetic presence attracted attention from major media outlets like GQ, Forbes, Entrepreneur, and Variety. With a rapidly growing fan base of 10 million followers across social media platforms, Harry’s star power is undeniable.</p><p>In addition to his reality TV success, he has ventured into various entertainment and business endeavors. One of his notable projects is the interactive show Dating Harry Jowsey, hosted on Spotify. In this show, Harry engages with fans, answering their burning questions about dating, relationships, and everything in between.</p><p>That’s not all, Harry also expanded his reach into the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">podcasting</a> world with Tap In, a podcast where no topic is off-limits. He fearlessly dives into discussions that others might shy away from, fostering open-minded conversations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-harry-jowsey-is-paired-with-the-newest-professional-dancer>Harry Jowsey Is Paired With The Newest Professional Dancer</h2><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DWTS</a> has a history of introducing unexpected contestants, from Peloton instructor Cody Rigsby to IndyCar driver James Hinchcliffe. However, Harry’s entry into the world of competitive dancing is unique, as he represents the first dating show contestant from a platform other than The Bachelor or The Bachelorette. When Harry graces the DWTS stage on September 26, he’ll be stepping onto the dance floor with a new professional partner.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rylee Arnold</a> is new to DWTS, but has a family legacy on the show. For those who may not know, Rylee’s older sister, Lindsay Arnold, has been a professional on DWTS since season 16 and even coached Rylee when she appeared as a junior ballroom dancer on Dancing With the Stars: Juniors in 2018. With her family ties to the show, Rylee is no stranger to the DWTS world. She watched her sister Lindsay achieve success, including winning the Mirrorball Trophy in season 25 alongside singer and actor Jordan Fisher.</p><p>Now, as Harry’s partner, the big question is whether the younger Arnold sister will add her own Mirrorball Trophy to the family collection. Only time will tell as the new season of DWTS premieres on September 26, at 8 p.m. on ABC and Disney Plus.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Original_RyleeArnold_DWTSKeyArt_ABCAndrew-Eccles-220x147.jpeg alt="Rylee Arnold Celebrates Becoming a ‘Dancing With the Stars’ pro in Candid Vlog" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xK%2Bcq7Gknbavs4ytpmajnqTEbq3BqKytZZSswbR5wp6jnpqinsG6eceaqauxXZ%2B8uL%2FEsmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
