After all, it’s just a place for a cat to do their business — and the options out there seem to only differ significantly in terms of style. However, there’s more than meets the eye when it comes to the right litter box.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to think about your individual cat and what they will feel comfortable using, says Kelly Fishman, DVM, in San Francisco, California. “Just like us humans, cats have strong preferences with [their] bathroom spaces. Whether your cat likes or dislikes the litter box is influenced by many factors,” she says. “This includes the type of litter, location, size and shape, and if the litter box is covered or not.”&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, think about where you will locate your cat’s box. Sean Penn, DVM, who practices in Scottsdale, Arizona, says litter box use issues can be complicated — and that not only is the type of litter box relevant, where you place it may matter as well. “For example, cats are highly sensitive to environmental influences such that litter box avoidance can involve the cat being uncomfortable in the box’s location due to it being in a noisy or high traffic location,” he says. “Problems can actually have a lot to do with the location of the box.”</p><h2 id=our-top-litter-boxes-for-cats-picks>Our top litter boxes for cats picks</h2><h3>Best “investment” litter box for cats: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Whisker Litter-Robot 4 Automatic Self-Cleaning Cat Litter Box</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Litter-Robot 4</h3></p><p>If money is no object, the Whisker Litter-Robot 4 is easily the best cat litter box available. Its compact design makes it easy to place in small living spaces, yet its wide, bowl-like interior and large waste bin makes it optimal for homes with up to four cats. This mechanical litter box will clean up after your cat automatically, and send live smartphone alerts via its companion app to let you know how full its waste compartment is, how much litter is left, and even your cat’s weight, among other key stats. The automatic cleaning process is surprisingly quiet, and if you do find its sifting sounds to be a little annoying, you can set its cleaning schedule via the app for a more convenient time.</p><p>One of the biggest ticks in the pro column is how well its tightly sealed waste compartment contains odors, making this a top litter box for apartments as well. And while its automatic cleaning function is this model’s top selling point, a range of little design perks—such as a textured step that catches litter when cats step out—make Whisker’s Litter-Robot 4 the all-around best litter box available.</p><p><a rel=alternate href=#>Read our full Litter-Robot 4 review>></a></p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 22 inches (width) x 27 inches (depth) x 29.5 inches (height)</li><li>Type: Automatic</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Weight: 24 pounds</li><li>Price: $699</li></ul><h4>Pros:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Can accommodate up to 4 cats</li><li>Programmable</li><li>Self-cleaning</li><li>Works with almost any type of litter&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Needs to be near an electrical outlet&nbsp;</li><li>Has a rounded shape that may not appeal to cats who prefer corners</li><li>Step may be too high for cats with mobility issues</li><li>Not compatible with non-clumping litter</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>The programmable Litter-Robot 4 saves you time by keeping the box clean while also notifying you of litter level, waste drawer level, your cat’s weight, and more.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Whisker Litter-Robot 4 Automatic Self-Cleaning Cat Litter Box</a></p><h3>Best budget litter box for cats: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Petmate Litter Pan</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Petmate Litter Pan, Color Varies, Large</h3></p><p>Whether you need to outfit your home with multiple litter boxes, are looking for a box for a larger cat, or are simply not down for blowing half your paycheck on a cat toilet, the Petmate Litter Pan shows that you don’t have to spend big bucks to get a quality litter box. Available in large and jumbo sizes, this inexpensive litter box features a solid design that was made to last, and its plastic utilizes Microban technology that minimizes the growth of odor and stain-causing bacteria.

The high-tech litter box sports multiple sensors and safety features to ensure your cat is outside the box before it starts to clean itself, while the enclosed space and roomy interior offers the privacy cats need.&nbsp;</p><p>The Purrclean’s smart app tracks how often your cat uses the litter box, their weight, and lets you know as soon as its convenient waste tray needs to be emptied. Switching over from your old litter box to the Purrclean is easy since this model is compatible with all clumping litters, and its integrated odor eliminator utilizes a high-pressure ozone chamber to break down cat aromas, making it one of the best-smelling litter boxes available. Sure, the Purrclean is a fairly expensive pick, but once you and your cat are used to its suite of sanitary features, it’d be hard to go back to a simple tray.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 20 inches (width) x 20 inches (depth) x 26.5 inches (height)&nbsp;</li><li>Type: Covered, self-cleaning, automatic</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Weight: 30 pounds</li><li>Price: $499.99</li></ul><h4>Pros:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>“Scoops” waste automatically&nbsp;</li><li>Can control cleaning frequency via app</li><li>Eliminates odors</li><li>Can use with any type of litter</li><li>Optimized for multiple cats</li><li>Quiet operation</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Drum-style interior may not appeal to cats that like corners</li><li>Interior may be too small for larger cats</li><li>Higher up entry point may be challenging for cats with mobility issues&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This ultra-quiet automatic litter box offers your cat spacious privacy, scoops automatically, and eliminates odors.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>INSTACHEW PURRCLEAN Smart WiFi Enabled Covered Automatic Self-Cleaning Cat Litter Box</a></p><h3>Best multi-cat litter box: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>FRISCO High Sided Cat Litter Box</a></h3><p>Between its roomy interior space, high walls, and non-stick plastic, the FRISCO High Sided extra large model is the best choice as a communal litter box. No two cats have the exact same potty habits, which is why it’s a good idea to buy a litter box with high walls, to keep spraying and litter-slinging behaviors contained. This spacious litter box is easy for larger cats to use, and gives multiple cats plenty of area to do their business. As an added bonus, this high-sided box’s low entry lip makes it easy for senior cats and young kittens alike to effortlessly walk into their shared bathroom.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 24 inches (width) x 18 inches (depth) x 10 inches (height)</li><li>Type: Pan</li><li>Material: BPA-free plastic</li><li>Weight: 2.9 pounds</li><li>Price: $27.49</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Large area for multiple cats</li><li>High sides help prevent litter and waste from escaping</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Only available in blue and gray</li><li>Open design may not appeal to cats who prefer privacy</li><li>Extra large size requires a bigger space&nbsp;</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>With its high sides to reduce litter scatter, this roomy BPA-free litter box is great for multiple cats.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>FRISCO High Sided Cat Litter Box</a></p><h3>Best litter box for kittens: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Van Ness Cat Litter Pan Size Small</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Van Ness Cat Litter Pan, Blue, Medium</h3></p><p>Anyone searching for a temporary litter box until an uncoordinated little kitten is able to use the grown-up version should consider the small, inexpensive, and portable Van Ness Cat Litter Pan.

If you value a virtually odor-free litter box area, its unique, blue, crystalized litter traps cat box smells up to five times better than traditional clumping or clay litter. (Just note that one crystal litter-filled tray, designed especially for use in this litter box, lasts between 20-30 days for one cat; <a rel=nofollow href=#>refills are around $70</a> for a pack of three.) This means that not only does it smell far better than the average model, its litter lasts five to ten times longer than normal litter, too. With its greatly reduced smell and handy automated cleaning cycle that activates 20 minutes after your cat leaves the box, this durable and fairly priced model is easily the best option for keeping your home fresh.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 19.1 inches (width) x 27.6 inches (depth) x 6 inches (height)</li><li>Type: Automatic</li><li>Material: Plastic, silicone</li><li>Weight: 18.64 pounds</li><li>Price: $199.95</li></ul><h4>Pros:</h4><ul><li>Eliminates odors from waste</li><li>Automatic cleaning rake</li><li>Durable</li><li>99% dust-free</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Can only use the specialty crystal litter tray refills designed for this unit</li><li>Open design may not appeal to cats that like privacy&nbsp;</li><li>Expensive</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This space-saving automatic litter box reduces odor with its fast-acting crystal litter that absorbs and dehydrates waste.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>PetSafe ScoopFree Original Automatic Self-Cleaning Cat Litter Box</a></p><h3>Best top entry litter box for cats: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>IRIS Round Top Entry Cat Litter Box Scoop</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>IRIS Round Top Entry Cat Litter Box Scoop</h3></p><p>Cat parents who are tired of cleaning up litter trails won’t know how they lived without an IRIS Round Top Entry Cat Litter Box. This box’s large, bucket-like enclosure delivers the privacy that cats need, and eliminates spray, waste, or those grody litter trails that tend to follow cats outside of the box. In addition, its grooved lid scrapes off lingering litter particles that may have stuck to their paws on the way out, and it’s a snap to remove for quick and easy cleaning. When you consider the rugged lid’s ability to hold cats weighing up to 20 pounds, its extra-spacious interior, and four available color options, this is easily the most versatile top entry litter box out there.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 16.14 inches (width) x 20.47 inches (depth) x 14.56 inches (height)</li><li>Type: Top entry</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Weight: 4.85 pounds</li><li>Price: $34.99-39.99</li></ul><h4>Pros:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Easy to clean</li><li>Supports all litter types</li><li>Available in four colors</li></ul><h4>Cons:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Top entry may be challenging for seniors, kittens, and cats with mobility issues</li><li>Scooping requires taking off the top lid</li><li>Top lid is an additional element to clean</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>With a large top entryway for ease of entering, this litter box prevents litter scatter while the grooved lid helps remove litter from your cat’s paws while exiting.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>IRIS Round Top Entry Cat Litter Box Scoop</a></p><h3>Best sifting litter box for cats: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Arm Hammer Sifting Cat Litter Pan</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Arm Hammer Sifting Cat Litter Pan</h3></p><p>Most sifting litter boxes simply focus on convenience, but the Arm & Hammer Sifting Cat Litter Pan sports a specialized design that lessens lingering cat box odors. Cleaning this litter box is as easy as lifting the top sifter pan and watching as it effortlessly filters out the waste while dropping the clean litter back into the pan beneath. Again, there are other sifting litter boxes on the market, but Arm & Hammer’s antimicrobial-infused plastic actively eliminates odor-causing bacteria, which goes a long way toward making your cat’s litter — and the room itself — smell fresher for longer.</p><h4>Specifications:</h4><ul><li>Dimensions: 15.2 inches (width) x 18.9 inches (depth) x 7.9 inches (height)</li><li>Type: Sifting/pan</li><li>Material: Plastic</li><li>Weight: 2.29 pounds</li><li>Price: $16.73</li></ul><h4>Pros:&nbsp;</h4><ul><li>Easy to sift litter</li><li>Antimicrobial plastic minimizes odor</li><li>High sides help contain excess litter</li></ul><h4>Cons:</h4><ul><li>Only available in large</li><li>Open design may not appeal to cats who prefer privacy</li></ul><h4>The bottom line:</h4><p>This three-pan system sifts litter when you lift the top pan, while its Microban surface prevents stains and odors.</p><p><strong>Get it here:</strong> <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Arm Hammer Sifting Cat Litter Pan</a></p><h3>Best hidden litter box for cats: <a class=affiliate-link-link rel=nofollow href=#>Good Pet Stuff Hidden Cat Litter Planter</a></h3><p><h3 class=title>Good Pet Stuff Hidden Cat Litter Planter</h3></p><p>Even dedicated pet parents would rather not make a litter box the focal point of a room, especially if they have to place it in a smaller, shared area, so it’s easy to see the appeal of the Good Pet Stuff Hidden Cat Litter Planter. This deceptively roomy, covered litter box is shaped and textured like a clay plant pot, with a realistic artificial fern on top to complete the illusion. Spacious enough for larger cats and multi-cat homes, it’s a snap to disassemble for cleaning. As an added bonus, its innovative venting system works surprisingly well to keep dust and odors from escaping. Best of all, though?

Some are extremely simple litter boxes that are little more than a basic plastic tray, while others offer features like apps.</p><h3>Design</h3><p>Different cats prefer different types of boxes, so I picked a selection of open boxes with low or high sides, and covered boxes. There are also a variety of sizes to accommodate small kittens to larger cats, and a range of shapes like rectangular, triangular, and domed. Several of the litter boxes also offer apps.</p><h3>Durability</h3><p>The best litter boxes are durable and made of materials that will last. Usually, this is primarily plastic but I included one product with a stainless steel base. Several of my picks are also odor-and stain-resistant, which increases the box’s longevity.</p><h3>Convenience</h3><p>For convenience, I included options like automatic scooping boxes that have an app notifying you of litter levels and other metrics. One of my picks sifts litter just by lifting up the top pan and I provide multiple options that are uncovered, which makes them easy to scoop. Boxes that fit into small spaces and boxes that look more like home decor are also included.</p><h2 id=things-to-consider-before-buying-a-litter-box>Things to consider before buying a litter box</h2><p>Your cat’s own preferences about where they feel most comfortable going to the bathroom isn’t about a pet being picky for the fun of it, but an important factor for their general health.</p><p>“If your cat finds their litter box environment unsuitable there is potential for trouble. Urinating or defecating outside the litter box and other serious medical conditions can arise,” warns Dr. Fishman. “Urinating outside the litter box is the number one reason cats are surrendered by their families.”</p><p>A cat’s size, age, and personality are all key factors to keep in mind when selecting the best litter box for them. While there’s no way to predict exactly how your cat will react to a new litter box, there are some questions to keep in mind when shopping that can help you find the best options:</p><h3>How big (or small) is your cat?</h3><p>You should think about the size of your cat before you commit to a litter box.&nbsp;</p><p>“Size is important only in that the cat should be able to fit in the litter box comfortably,” says Dr. Penn. “Cats have a natural instinct to use a moveable substrate in which they can bury their feces.” As a general rule, the litter box should be at least <a rel=nofollow href=#>one-and-a-half times </a>the length of your cat.</p><p>In addition, cats need to be able to jump or climb up into the litter box easily so they don’t hurt themselves. A heavier cat may not be able to reach its box if it is too far off the ground.&nbsp;</p><h3>How old is your cat?&nbsp;</h3><p>Senior cats or tiny kittens may require a shallow litter box with a low lip, making it easier for tired or uncoordinated cats to easily step in and out. “Sometimes with age and arthritis, they [cats may] have trouble getting into the box,” says Dr. Penn.</p><h3>How many cats are in your household?&nbsp;</h3><p>Multi-cat households need a wider litter box to accommodate more than one cat — and more than one litter box. “The current recommendation for the number of litter boxes for a household is one box per cat plus one. So one cat needs two boxes, two cats need three boxes, and so on,” adds Dr. Penn.&nbsp;</p><p>Since the litter box is a <a rel=nofollow href=#>key resource</a> just like food and water, it can be a source of stress in multi-cat homes. If you have a cat who is more dominant or territorial over resources, they may not want to share “their” litter boxes and they might intimidate housemates who are more passive. In these situations, it can be helpful to have more boxes than the ‘number of cats plus one’ rule.&nbsp;</p><h3>Does your cat like privacy? Hint: Some do!&nbsp;</h3><p>Some cats appreciate a <a rel=nofollow href=#>covered litter box</a> for the enclosed privacy (relatable!) and some owners may want to go the extra mile by purchasing a box that blends in seamlessly with their space.</p><h3>Do you work or are you at home during the day?&nbsp;</h3><p>Cleaning cat waste as soon as it appears is the best practice for litter box maintenance. For those willing to shell out a little more, you can even buy a model that automatically cleans the box while you’re away from home, which may be well worth the price of admission in many cases.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>Do cats prefer covered or uncovered litter boxes?</h3><p>Believe it or not, a study from the<a rel=nofollow href=#> Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine</a> actually explores this question, and the results suggest that cats will use covered or uncovered litter boxes equally without a preference. Since cats don’t really seem to care, it’s up to you to pick the litter box style that best suits your situation.</p><p>Some cat owners appreciate the simplicity of cleaning an uncovered pan-style litter box without having to remove the cover each time, while others appreciate how a covered litter box helps to keep litter from being kicked onto the floor. Both are equally valid options, but keep in mind that there are plenty of other varieties available, too, such as sifting, top entry, and smart automatic litter boxes.</p><h3>How do I keep my litter box from smelling in the house?</h3><p>There are multiple techniques for preventing a cat’s litter box from leaking its stench all over your house. The obvious step of cleaning the litter box daily will only get you so far, so look out for kitty litter varieties with pleasant fragrances, or a brand with odor-absorbing properties to minimize the smell between cleanings. Automatic litter boxes are usually designed with compartments that store cat waste until you’re ready to dispose of it, which helps to reduce the smell. If the litter box continues to stink despite it being “clean,” it may be time to replace its contents with all-new litter.&nbsp;</p><p>While keeping an air purifier or scented air fresheners close to the cat box are tempting ideas, they only mask odors, and removing the source of the smell is always the best way to deal with the problem.</p><h3>Where should I place the litter box?</h3><p>A cat’s litter box should be set in a calm, quiet, and private place that allows them to take care of their business in peace. This place should be easily accessible, and set away from loud appliances that may frighten them. They should also be far away from their food and water bowls. Not only should there be a cat box per cat in your home, there should be a cat box on every level of your home, so the cat has easy access to it at a moment’s notice. If you have small children or pets that may be tempted to get into the cat’s litter box, consider installing a small baby fence in the doorway to keep them out, one that allows cats to easily bound over as needed.</p><p>When cats are in the litter box, they may feel more vulnerable. Though we view cats as predators, instinctually, they know they’re prey too. If you have a dominant cat and a submissive cat, be sure to place litter boxes in spacious areas where the more submissive cat can see their bully coming and have ways to escape. If your submissive cat spends more time in a particular area, put a litter box there as long as it’s not near food, water, and their bed. Using feline pheromone sprays and adding more areas where cats can eat and rest also helps reduce overall stress between a dominant and submissive cat.</p><h3>How often do you need to clean your cat’s litter box?</h3><p>You should remove the waste from your cat’s litter box once or twice a day, but if you own multiple cats and have set up additional litter boxes, you will likely need to clean your litter box even more frequently to keep it under control. Not only will this practice make your space smell much better, a clean litter box will encourage your cat to use it, as opposed to finding other, cleaner places around your home to do their business (like, for example, your laundry hamper). Some cats will only use a dirty litter box as a last resort, and may develop painful urinary conditions from holding in their urine if faced with a filthy tray.</p><p>It’s also ideal to totally dump out all the litter and wash the box with soap and hot water every one to two weeks. Plastic is porous and retains smells but be careful about using bleach. Bleach mixed with the ammonia in cat urine creates a noxious gas. On top of that, bleach can leave a lingering smell and though you may not notice it, your cat who is up close and personal with their box, will. If you don’t like the thought of washing the box because you don’t have a utility sink or a yard, consider using litter box liners.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmasoJ%2Blvaq6xmiYq6yZmLmme8Geqq1lnJ7BtbHRZpmosJWoeqe70WaamqyjZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
