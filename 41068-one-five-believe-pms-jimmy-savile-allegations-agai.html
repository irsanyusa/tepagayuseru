Keir Starmer has revealed that he has <a href=#>received death threats</a> as a result of the remarks, and required police protection after <a href=#>being accosted by a mob</a> on the issue.</p><p>Recent YouGov polling for The Times conducted on 10-11 February found that 87% of Britons were aware of the remarks to some degree, including 37% who said they were following the story “very” or “fairly” closely.</p><p>Asked, based on what they had seen and heard, whether they thought the prime minister’s claims were true or false, one in five Britons say that they are “probably true” (20%). Twice as many say “probably false” (42%), with the remaining 37% unsure.</p><p>Almost half of current Conservative voters (48%) believe the claims to be probably true, with only 18% suggesting they are probably false. Among those who backed the party in 2019, those figures are 39% and 26%, respectively.</p><p>Current Labour voters are far less convinced, with 70% saying they think the claims are probably false, with only 5% considering them to be likely true.</p><p>Most Britons (56%) think the allegations made by the prime minister are inappropriate, however. Only 15% of people think that making such claims was appropriate.</p><p>Current Conservative voters are divided, with 38% seeing them as inappropriate versus 34% who see them as appropriate. Those who backed the party at the last election are less equivocal, saying that such remarks are not appropriate by 46% to 27%.</p><p>Those who currently say they will back Labour consider the allegations inappropriate by 79% to 4%.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmixn6q0sMKNnKZnrZtkvbC4yK2gnKtflr%2B1tcKlnKxnZGZ9d4SMqKWeZZaew6Z5wZ6jop2mmnqxudJmoaKlna56tK3VoqOeZZGhuaazwK2gqKajYq6orcg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
