I am so sad doing this but if this will help me get back to school, I don’t mind.</p><p>I have been suffering and yet I have a dad who is well to do. My mum has been trying her little best to clothe, shelter and feed me but all I ask from him is to pay my school fees so as to be a better citizen and take care of him when he’s old.</p><p>Please I need you to reach out to him or please support my mum to pay my school fees, God bless you.”</p><p>However, the Public Relations Officer of the Lagos State Police Command,<strong> DSP Bala Elkana</strong>, has reacted to the video saying he has seen it and that police are going to investigate it.</p><p>Speaking to Punch about the video, Elkana said: “We have not received a complaint from anybody on that issue. We have watched the video and our operatives within that area are mandated to commence investigation on the issue immediately. I don’t want to preempt investigation.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“We have to investigate the man because the allegation is about him. We have to listen to the wife, daughter, and sister who were witnesses. Professionally we have the mandate as police to investigate. I am going to update you on the outcome of the investigation,”</p><p>However, Odega has responded with another video telling his side of the story.</p><p>The actor said he gave his wife N7M to buy a property for him and has not seen the property since then. He also said he paid N900k for his daughter's school fees last term adding that the school just resumed and nobody has sent her out of school because of school fees.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>In 2015, Francis Odega’s a hilarious video clip ‘gerarahere’ brought him to limelight and also earned him endorsement deals.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGapp5yesKZ506hkoqammsC1tcaaq55llqeur6%2FIrGSonJWcrm671Z6pZpyZqMG2vsGipaBlpp6xpruOrZubb56ivQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
