Like any pricey purchase where you could run into operational issues, a warranty is a necessity. Read the fine print to see what is covered, how the company handles replacements, and how long your coverage lasts.</p><h2 id=how-we-selected-the-best-adjustable-beds>How we selected the best adjustable beds</h2><p>Though I’m extremely familiar with the complexities of shopping for mattresses (I’ve written extensively about mattresses, bedding, and beds), additional expertise was sought for choosing the best adjustable beds from experts due to their use to support health concerns. All of our selections were made with input from our two medical experts, as well as thorough research and checking that any adjustable bed that made our list has overwhelmingly positive customer reviews.</p><h2 id=what-is-an-adjustable-bed-and-who-is-it-best-for>What is an adjustable bed and who is it best for?</h2><p>“An adjustable bed has a versatile frame that lets you modify your head and foot positions using a motorized mechanism, ideal for many different sleeping preferences and health needs,” says Harris. “It's ideal for people with specific health concerns, or those seeking personalized comfort for sleeping or activities like reading in bed.”</p><p>“They may be a great solution for those with back pain or those who need to elevate their legs,” agrees Purdy. “It’s great for those who need customized support–if you need to change your position but need help in doing so, for example, an adjustable bed can do this with a change in setting.”</p><h2 id=adjustable-bed-vs-adjustable-mattress>Adjustable bed vs. adjustable mattress</h2><p>“An adjustable bed is the movable frame, specifically for giving you more freedom with all sleeping positions, while an adjustable mattress is designed to flex and adapt to these varying angles and contours,” explains Harris. “Together, they create a customizable sleep system, helping people find personalized comfort by adjusting their bed's positioning and the mattress' shape to better suit their individual preferences.”</p><h2 id=how-to-shop-for-an-adjustable-bed>How to shop for an adjustable bed</h2><p>“When shopping for an adjustable bed, think about how much you need features—like an extended range of motion—while also looking for something that’s compatible with your mattress,” says Harris.</p><p>“Try it out in person when you can,” advises Purdy. “Make sure you’re comfortable with using the bed. Read reviews, too, and select a bed that will be the best fit for your specific needs, goals, and preferences.”</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What are the disadvantages of an adjustable bed?</h3><p>“Adjustable beds offer a lot of versatility, but they can be pricier,” admits Harris. “They might also require compatible mattresses other than the one you already own, and may have specific maintenance needs.”</p><h3>Do doctors recommend adjustable beds?</h3><p>It depends on your needs, but it’s certainly possible. “Your doctor could recommend an adjustable bed for health conditions like sleep apnea, acid reflux, and back pain, as they can help with symptoms by letting you customize the bed to your sleeping position,” confirms Harris.</p><h3>Are adjustable bed frames worth it?</h3><p>It really depends on your requirements. As Harris sums it up, “The value of an adjustable bed frame is based on your personal sleep preferences and health needs.”</p><h3>What are the benefits of using an adjustable bed?</h3><p>There are multiple potential benefits to using an adjustable bed, as Harris points out: “Adjustable beds offer customizable settings to cater to your sleeping position, potentially alleviating health issues like sleep apnea, acid reflux, and back pain while enhancing overall comfort and relaxation, making them a versatile option for improved sleep quality.”</p><h3>Can you use any mattress with an adjustable bed?</h3><p>“Not all mattresses are compatible with adjustable beds,” warns Harris. “Memory foam, latex, and air mattresses are a good option because of their flexibility. Innerspring mattresses might not adapt as well to the adjustable base and are less compatible. Always check the compatibility of the mattress you already have before using it with an adjustable bed to make sure they’re going to work together and to avoid damage.”</p><h3>How can you keep sheets from slipping with an adjustable bed?</h3><p>To prevent sheets from slipping on an adjustable bed, Harris suggests using sheet clips, deep-pocket fitted sheets, or specialized fasteners that are designed to secure them in place.</p><h3>Can you use health insurance or Medicare to pay for an adjustable bed?</h3><p>Coverage for an adjustable bed through health insurance depends on your individual policy. Medicare can cover adjustable beds, but you’ll need to <a href=# rel=nofollow>prove that it’s a medical requirement</a>, usually relating to conditions such as cardiac disease or severe arthritis.</p><p>The information presented here is created by TIME Stamped and overseen by TIME editorial staff.
