Sixty-seven percent of self-identified avid sports fans said they enjoy watching baseball’s talent showcase, compared to 63 percent for both the NBA All-Star Game and Pro Bowl. The NHL All-Star Game is enjoyable for 38 percent of avid sports fans.</p><p class=mb-s>When asked to pick a favorite, avid sports fans are split almost evenly between the top three choices, as 28 percent favor the MLB All-Star Game, compared to 27 percent for both the NBA All-Star Game and Pro Bowl.</p><p class=mb-s>The survey also sought to test how popular each all-star event was among adults who were interested in that specific sport. It found that the NBA set the bar among this group: Sixty-five percent of people who identify as very or somewhat interested in basketball say they enjoy watching the NBA All-Star Game, compared with 58 percent of football fans who like watching the Pro Bowl.</p><p class=mb-s>People interested in baseball also enjoy their sport’s All-Star Game (64 percent) more than football fans enjoy the Pro Bowl. Just over half of people interested in hockey say they like watching the NHL All-Star Game.</p><p class=mb-s>Each of the leagues also holds a night of skill-based competitions in the days leading up to their showcase games. The survey results show that an almost-equal number of sports fans enjoy the NBA Skills Competition, MLB’s Home Run Derby and the NFL’s Pro Bowl Skills Showdown, each of which resonates with about 2 in 5 respondents. Among avid fans, however, the Home Run Derby is the most-liked, with 67 percent saying they enjoy watching it.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6W%2FsHnBqK6lZaSkvbR5zKWZZqaSlnqiuMtmqq2ZomK0ornErGSaq12ovbC%2B06xkn5meqHqnrdWoqaKslWLBorjEp6tmq5ikxKSt0p4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
