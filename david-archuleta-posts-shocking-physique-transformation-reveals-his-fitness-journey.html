Archuleta recently posted progress pictures of himself in the gym and fans are shocked at his physique’s progress.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-david-archuleta-says-he-s-in-beast-mode-displaying-his-muscular-physique>David Archuleta Says He’s in “Beast Mode” Displaying His Muscular Physique</h2><p>Over the weekend, the 32-year-old singer showcased his muscular and toned physique in a short video and a series of images on social media. Fans were quick to ask what caused the sudden change in physical progress and Archuleta was there to oblige them.</p><p>“Every January during my down time I tend to get really lazy, start eating lots of ice cream, and sulk while I’m home,” Archuleta said. “This year I am sticking to a routine and aiming to get them gains! 2023 I’m coming for you.”</p><p>When asked by a fan if he’s being assisted by a trainer, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Archuleta</a> answered that he consults one from time to time. He admitted at first that he didn’t know how to properly pace himself while working out. Which resulted in injuries that caused a lack of motivation.</p><p>Archuleta has set new goals for himself this year, as he expressed the desire to improve both physically and mentally. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">singer</a> has been outspoken about his struggle to reconcile his Mormon religion. This occurred after coming out as gay, which took a toll on his mental aspect of things.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Archuleta’s Fitness Lifestyle Has Given Him Peace With The Mormon Church</h2><p>After taking a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">step back</a> from the Mormon church, Archuleta kept himself occupied with working out during his free time. His workout routine has done wonders to his previously average physique which also helped the singer be at ease with his sexual orientation.</p><p>“For my own mental health, I can’t keep putting myself in a place where it’s so conflicting. It hurts me because my religion was everything for me,” Archuleta said. “But you get to a point where you realize there are some things not right here. I need to just live my life, because I already know I’m okay how I am.”</p><p>Archuleta was previously engaged three times with different women but broke off with them each time. After coming out as queer in the summer of 2021, he revealed he called off his last engagement just a couple of months before. Currently, he’s gone on a journey of self-acceptance and is fully embracing his sexuality, but continues to have thoughts about his former church</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Original_Libianca_Elizabeth-MorrisNBCNBCU-Photo-Bank-via-Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="‘The Voice’ Alum Libianca Stuns in Official Music Video of Her Single “People”" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57w5qtopxdlr%2BktNSlnK2ZXaW8tMDSZqqhp5Ogtq%2BzjKmfsquZpsKmedOrmKerlqS%2Frq3ToqanZaKaw6aty6xkoaGjYrOqwM2eqqxlmqTCs7rEsmY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
