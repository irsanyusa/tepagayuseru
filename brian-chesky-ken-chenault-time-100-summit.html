A member of Airbnb’s board, he has known Chesky for about a decade. When COVID-19 began and affected the company, causing it to lose 80% of its revenue in eight weeks, </span><span style=font-weight:400>Chenault advised Chesky, </span><span style=font-weight:400>“this is your defining moment as a leader.”</span><br>[time-brightcove not-tgx=”true”]</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Drawing on his experience working in the business world in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks and the 2008 financial crisis, Chenault said what Chesky went through leading Airbnb was “10 times worse.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The duo also discussed the impact of <a href=#>artificial intelligence</a> on the future of humanity. Chesky said he thinks AI is the most powerful tool ever invented. “[We] might experience a hundred years of change in the next twenty years,” he said. “Every child in the world could have a tutor that’s better than the best teacher you’ve ever had. Imagine if everyone could have access to the most unbelievable medical care that you could ever imagine. It is the ultimate equalizer.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Chenault said that it’s crucial to find a balance of engagement between the private and public sectors as companies integrate AI technology. “It can close the gap on a lot of inequalities that exist in our society, but it is going to require a new level of cooperation and on the part of companies, a new level of selflessness,” Chenault said. “The government alone can’t do it. The private sector alone can’t do it. No single company can do it.”</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The two businessmen delved into the unintended consequences of AI, warning that it’s naive to believe that technology will only be used for good and noting the importance of combating misinformation and verifying identities online.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>“As we spend more time connecting with people online, we’re actually not connecting offline in the real world,” Chesky said. “Our Instagram followers aren’t coming to our funeral.”</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmacp5yhsqTAyKilZqifqMFwgpFwa2ttYmSvs7XAp2ScoJWouLp5yp6lZpuYmruiwcutZK2hnZp6cnyPZqqupZ2ewXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
