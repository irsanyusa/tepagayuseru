During his final NFL season, when he won Super Bowl 50, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer text-primary hover:underline" tabindex=0 href=#>Forbes</a> ranked him as the 27th highest-paid athlete with $34.2 million between salary and endorsements, listing off-the-field partnerships that included Gatorade, Buick and Papa John’s International Inc.</p><p class=mb-s>Jimmy Sanderson, assistant professor in the Department of Kinesiology and Sport Management at Texas Tech University, said Manning’s image as a “good country boy, old-fashioned guy” who steers clear of controversy helps make him a relatable figure.</p><p class=mb-s>“He doesn’t talk about politics,” he said. “He doesn’t really do anything that would make him divisive.”</p><p class=mb-s>The NFL is America’s dominant sports league, home to 40 of the top 50 live sporting events in 2018, according to Nielsen, and Manning was joined at the top of the Morning Consult ranking by a number of media personalities with an ongoing connection to the league. That includes veteran play-by-play commentators Al Michaels of NBC’s “Sunday Night Football,” Mike Tirico of NBC and Jim Nantz of CBS. Avid sports fans also rated Michaels’ color co-pilot Cris Collinsworth and Nantz’s broadcast partner, Tony Romo, highly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX6WyusDOp2SmmZ6jtq%2BzjK2mqatdoba0wIympqysXaG8t7HDZqqpp6KpwG65xJ2gmmWgmr%2B0u82ao6KsmZrA</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
