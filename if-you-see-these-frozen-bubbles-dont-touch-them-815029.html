Gingerbread cookies and sitting by&nbsp;the fireplace and... frozen methane bubbles? Freezing temperatures afford humanity the pleasure of&nbsp;some very weird winter phenomena. Let’s go&nbsp;take a&nbsp;look at&nbsp;some of&nbsp;them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e68/345/dfc8f65ee59e195b8fea1238e5.png><p>Beneath the surface of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Canada data-link=tag>Canada</a>’s Lake Abraham, in&nbsp;Alberta, or&nbsp;beneath other lakes across <a href=# title=Antarctica data-link=tag>Antarctica</a>, you’ll witness a&nbsp;truly mesmerizing phenomenon of&nbsp;<a href=# title=ice data-link=tag>ice</a> bubbles. From the top, they look like glittering jewels. But these bubbles don’t meet our expectations, as&nbsp;they never pop. They just freeze midway, before ever reaching the surface. So&nbsp;how did they get there in&nbsp;the first place? And what are they made&nbsp;of? Some of&nbsp;them come from <a href=# title=gas data-link=tag>gas</a> released from the melting of&nbsp;glaciers, while others are a&nbsp;result of&nbsp;the decomposing of&nbsp;the organic matter lying at&nbsp;the bottom of&nbsp;the lakes. Now, they sure look pretty but they are also pretty harmful to&nbsp;human life. These bubbles are made of&nbsp;methane and they can intoxicate you. So, if&nbsp;I were you, I&nbsp;wouldn’t get too close!</p><p>If&nbsp;you’re driving on&nbsp;a&nbsp;curvy hillside road when a&nbsp;snow squall begins, you’d be&nbsp;wise to&nbsp;stop driving immediately! A&nbsp;snow squall is&nbsp;the winter equivalent of&nbsp;a&nbsp;severe thunderstorm. The thing&nbsp;is, they are difficult to&nbsp;predict and very fast-moving. There can be&nbsp;sunshine, but then all of&nbsp;a&nbsp;sudden, a&nbsp;huge snow squall might start. If&nbsp;you haven’t heard this term before, it’s because the National <a href=# title=Weather data-link=tag>Weather</a> Service in&nbsp;the&nbsp;US only began using it&nbsp;in&nbsp;2018. They called it&nbsp;a&nbsp;squall because it&nbsp;reduces a&nbsp;lot our visibility and can be&nbsp;very dangerous if&nbsp;you don’t take it&nbsp;seriously. But still, falling snow is&nbsp;beautiful, even if&nbsp;it’s that crazy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a05/d49/ed44aa5ba9a93d61b8bdf43543.png><p>Say this winter you decided to&nbsp;finally visit the famous Niagara Falls. Located between the&nbsp;US and Canada, these falls are the fifth largest waterfall in&nbsp;the world with over 3,000 tons of&nbsp;falling water per second. In&nbsp;winter, the area looks like a&nbsp;winter wonderland and is&nbsp;home to&nbsp;an&nbsp;interesting phenomenon: a&nbsp;frozen fall. No, this isn’t a&nbsp;work of&nbsp;Hollywood or&nbsp;an&nbsp;internet prank. Niagara falls can actually form a&nbsp;layer of&nbsp;ice. This happens when the falls have been exposed to&nbsp;frigid temperatures for a&nbsp;long time. So&nbsp;the surface water and mist in&nbsp;the air turn to&nbsp;ice giving the impression that the entire waterfall is&nbsp;frozen&nbsp;— but that’s not exactly what happens. If&nbsp;you look closely into the ice, you’ll notice that there is&nbsp;still plenty of&nbsp;flowing water.</p><p>Have you ever heard of&nbsp;something called a&nbsp;natural snowball? This is&nbsp;a&nbsp;rare yet beautiful environmental phenomenon that happens when smaller pieces of&nbsp;ice end up&nbsp;being rolled by&nbsp;strong winds and water. The further they roll, the more ice they gather, and the more that ice is&nbsp;polished. They end up&nbsp;as&nbsp;giant perfectly shaped snowballs. They would look pretty amazing on&nbsp;their own, but hundreds of&nbsp;them together, that’s some scenery! Some snowballs turn into huge, rolling donuts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/6cb/598/af1fa653a4a18d6a3c7b96b9b4.png><p>These rare shapes happen only in&nbsp;perfect temperature conditions when the snow is&nbsp;in&nbsp;the perfect state between hard and fluffy. It&nbsp;happens when a&nbsp;snowball begins rolling down, gathering more and more snow until suddenly its middle part collapses. This allows for the snowball to&nbsp;get its donut shape! Hmm, does it&nbsp;also taste as&nbsp;good as&nbsp;a&nbsp;donut? I&nbsp;guess not, right. Ah, almost forgot&nbsp;— if&nbsp;you wanna see them in&nbsp;real life, you’ll have to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;some severely cold places. But still, people reported having seen them in&nbsp;Ottawa, in&nbsp;the Midwest of&nbsp;the&nbsp;US, and even in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Scotland data-link=tag>Scotland</a>!</p><p>If&nbsp;you go&nbsp;for a&nbsp;walk in&nbsp;the woods at&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;winter, you might stumble upon a&nbsp;magical phenomenon known as&nbsp;frost flowers. These flower-shaped phenomena are rare and occur only when the temperature of&nbsp;the air is&nbsp;freezing but the ground is&nbsp;still moist. When the perfect conditions align, vapor coming out of&nbsp;stems form these veil-thin patterns that make up&nbsp;delicate flower-like ice. Don’t try to&nbsp;pick them, you’ll break them! And certainly don’t try to&nbsp;plant them anywhere else, as&nbsp;they aren’t real flowers. Oh, and be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;go&nbsp;before the <a href=# title=sun data-link=tag>sun</a> is&nbsp;too strong, otherwise it&nbsp;will melt these delicate things.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f3b/998/3959135b2cb6eef3db95978fc1.png><p>Say you just checked the forecast and the weather for the day is −8&nbsp;F. Maybe you’d choose staying home underneath the blankets, but I’m sure you’d change your mind if&nbsp;you had the option of&nbsp;this day trip. Picture Yellowstone park under a&nbsp;few feet of&nbsp;snow on&nbsp;a&nbsp;sunny day. If&nbsp;that didn’t do&nbsp;it&nbsp;for you, then add some snow-covered bison and steamy geysers to&nbsp;the scenery. Still not convinced? How about the chance to&nbsp;see the rare phenomenon of&nbsp;hoarfrost? If&nbsp;you haven’t heard of&nbsp;them before, they are a&nbsp;geometrically enchanting type of&nbsp;frost that you can see when moisture in&nbsp;the air skips the droplet stage and appears directly as&nbsp;ice crystals on&nbsp;top of&nbsp;a&nbsp;leaf. They are much more photogenic than your windshield or&nbsp;garden variety frost. FYI, the term hoarfrost comes from Old English meaning a&nbsp;frost that resembles an&nbsp;old man’s beard. What do&nbsp;you say? Does this actually look like a&nbsp;beard?</p><p>You are walking in&nbsp;a&nbsp;frost-covered forest on&nbsp;a&nbsp;freezing day when suddenly, you hear a&nbsp;loud banging sound. No, it’s not an&nbsp;avalanche nor an&nbsp;earthquake&nbsp;— you’re in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;frostquake. If&nbsp;only that meant that you’d see beautiful snow crystals cracking on&nbsp;the floor, but that’s not quite the case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8fe/1c8/60aba85e50b441b78baf345ad2.png><p>Frostquakes, also known as&nbsp;ice quakes, happen when the moisture below the ground starts to&nbsp;freeze and expand. It’s normal for things to&nbsp;expand in&nbsp;their frozen state&nbsp;— just look at&nbsp;an&nbsp;ice cube for example. These frostquakes can move rocks and the soil above and cause loud cracking sounds as&nbsp;if&nbsp;the world were falling apart. Don’t worry though&nbsp;— it’s not.</p><p>If&nbsp;you happen to&nbsp;see black ice, be&nbsp;careful! Although we&nbsp;call it&nbsp;that, black ice isn’t really black. It’s made up&nbsp;of&nbsp;a&nbsp;thin layer of&nbsp;ice that looks black due to&nbsp;the color of&nbsp;concrete or&nbsp;earthy ground. It&nbsp;blends in&nbsp;so&nbsp;well with the ground that it’s almost impossible to&nbsp;spot! It&nbsp;forms during winter days when the ground is&nbsp;wet from rain or&nbsp;melted snow and the temperature suddenly drops below freezing temperatures. So&nbsp;this thin layer emerges, multiplying considerably your chances of&nbsp;slipping while walking on&nbsp;bridges or&nbsp;overpasses. It’s also pretty common on&nbsp;spots on&nbsp;the road that are shaded by&nbsp;trees.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/3ca/a7f/cb747d54bab975f730eee7862a.png><p>This next phenomenon happens in&nbsp;a&nbsp;very specific wintery context: the Antarctic one. Amongst the unique things that occur on&nbsp;the continent, Antarctica is&nbsp;home to&nbsp;an&nbsp;extremely weird waterfall. The year was 1911 when an&nbsp;Australian geologist wondered about the so-called ‘blood falls’. He&nbsp;was extremely puzzled by&nbsp;this red stream of&nbsp;liquid pouring from a&nbsp;small hillside amongst the Antarctic ice. After years of&nbsp;studying, it&nbsp;was understood that what caused the redness was the high iron content in&nbsp;the water. The last piece of&nbsp;the puzzle came when scientists discovered that there was an&nbsp;underground lake with water full of&nbsp;oxidized iron nearby, which was what caused the blood fall to&nbsp;exist in&nbsp;the first place.</p><p>The North Pole is&nbsp;more than Santa’s fictional home. Together with the South Pole, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;home to&nbsp;the so-called Polar Vortex, a&nbsp;phenomenon that helps to&nbsp;enhance our winter experience. The polar vortex is&nbsp;a&nbsp;large area of&nbsp;low-pressure and cold air. It’s called a&nbsp;vortex simply because over there the air rotates counterclockwise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/e8b/b91/a45f4c508d907ffa7a8f1123a0.png><p>It&nbsp;sends a&nbsp;jet stream that makes you wanna bundle up&nbsp;and helps induce several winter phenomena such as&nbsp;freezing fog. If&nbsp;fog is&nbsp;when a&nbsp;cloud touches the ground, what happens when it&nbsp;freezes? You can expect that all of&nbsp;the moist droplets of&nbsp;water that are hanging around in&nbsp;the air will possibly freeze when they touch the ground. Meaning you really wouldn’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;driving around in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;these things!</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLanediorGarlZp6tbTErJxmnqKkx6a6jJusm5qcmsBusM6nq2asn6qwqXnToZymZWhmgnF%2BmGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
