The bear that's part of the offer usually costs $14.</p><p>While the retailer doesn't ask customers for any proof of identification, it's only available to members of Build-A-Bear's Bonus Club, which shoppers can enroll in for free online.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"Count Your Candles" launched after chaos ensued at Build-A-Bear's "Pay Your Age Day" deal on July 12, when parents in the US, Canada, and the UK came out in droves with their kids to purchase a stuffed animal at a discount.</p><p>By 11 a.m. ET, stores were so overwhelmed by the crowds that Build-A-Bear had to pull the plug on the deal.</p><p>Holy moly build a bear! #pa... @ rachelivey2013</p><p>While the day's events were certainly effective in bringing the company into the limelight, <a href=# id=18280de7-164f-5f80-a021-cd106cf03528>at least one analyst said</a> that Build-A-Bear's reputation could take a hit as a result.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>"With much higher than anticipated demand for its 'Pay Your Age Day' promotion, Build-A-Bear has become a victim of its own success," Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to investors on Thursday.</p><p>He continued: "A lot of parents are now upset that they cannot fulfill promises to their children, and many who made special trips to malls are frustrated that their efforts have come to nothing. In our view, Build-A-Bear is going to have to take some action to remedy this, maybe by offering deals and special offers to those affected."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkr6p70q2pmqyVnMZwv9OrmK2dl656o8HIpZtmmV2XsqK%2BjKGYrGWRYrumw4ydnJqkXam8bsPOqGSsoJ%2Blvaa%2B0maYn6yVp3qxrdhmsKitomKuqLGMnZiyZZWjsaawjKKlaG6eaoV2fcs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
