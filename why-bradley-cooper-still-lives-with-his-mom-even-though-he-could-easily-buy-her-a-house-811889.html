However, it’s not only because of&nbsp;comfort, as&nbsp;a&nbsp;family tragedy is&nbsp;involved. In&nbsp;any case, the actor is&nbsp;blessed with a&nbsp;fantastic mother, and we’re happy that their bond only gets stronger every day.</p><p><h2>His mom introduced him to&nbsp;the world of&nbsp;entertainment.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/12c/ec4/cf8878542b8c53e85a4228be01.jpg><p>ANGELA WEISS/AFP/East News</p><p>When Bradley Cooper was a&nbsp;kid, his dad, Charles Cooper, worked as&nbsp;a&nbsp;stockbroker, and his mom, Gloria Campano, was a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>newscaster</a> for an&nbsp;NBC affiliate in&nbsp;Pennsylvania. His mom’s job got him interested in&nbsp;the industry, so&nbsp;while he&nbsp;was in&nbsp;high school, he&nbsp;followed his mom’s same path and got a&nbsp;job at&nbsp;the <i>Philadelphia Daily News</i>.</p><p><h2>His father suffered from lung cancer.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bd7/2c4/984ea05b4cb8b34f9f6c0fc55c.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>Later, Cooper’s father got diagnosed with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>lung</a> cancer, and he&nbsp;immediately moved to&nbsp;his parents’ house. The actor also decided to&nbsp;stop acting for a&nbsp;while to&nbsp;spend more time with his dad. The star tried everything he&nbsp;could to&nbsp;save his dad’s life and wanted to&nbsp;show him how much he&nbsp;cared for him. “With my&nbsp;father, it&nbsp;brought&nbsp;us together in&nbsp;a&nbsp;way that&nbsp;I didn’t even think was possible,” he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>recollects</a>.</p><p><h2>Campano was devastated by&nbsp;the loss.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/0ae/0ff/51c87d5ddf8091ea6eba14900c.jpg><p>Invision/Invision/East News</p><p>5&nbsp;months later, his father <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>passed</a> away. His mom was close to&nbsp;her husband, and the loss hit her hard. Since Cooper and his family have always been close-knit, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;asked his mom to&nbsp;come live with him in&nbsp;his place in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Los Angeles</a>.</p><p><h2>Cooper loves hanging around with his mom.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/123/e93/7de3e8592da8efed8b8d211e38.jpg><p>Associated Press/East News</p><p>The actor got candid about his relationship with his mom, and it’s indeed the best relationship anyone could wish for. “We&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>need</a> each other. But don’t get me&nbsp;wrong. It’s not without complications. It’s not like&nbsp;I live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;compound, and she’s in&nbsp;the guesthouse. She’s in&nbsp;the next room. But here’s the thing: She’s a&nbsp;cool chick. We&nbsp;can hang, and she can roll with the punches. If&nbsp;that wasn’t the case, there’s no&nbsp;way,” said the actor.</p><p><h2>Cooper’s girlfriend gets along with his mom too.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/779/e64/d5d8485445a34d60ea984616cb.jpg><p>Rumor has it&nbsp;Bradley Cooper and Irina Shayk broke up&nbsp;due to&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>conflicts</a> with his mom. However, it&nbsp;can’t be&nbsp;further from the truth. Shayk got along incredibly with Cooper’s mom&nbsp;— they were planning a&nbsp;vacation together! At&nbsp;the moment, Cooper and Shayk have gotten back <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>together</a> again, and their relationship is&nbsp;alive and kicking.</p><p><h2>They have an&nbsp;incredibly strong bond.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2de/a32/0f8b8c534a9d4bee737b2811cd.jpg><p>A.M.P.A.S./PictureLux/agefotostock/East News</p><p>Cooper and his mom still live together, even after 12&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>years</a>, because they depend on&nbsp;each other. Campano was heartbroken after losing her partner, but having her son around makes it&nbsp;easier for her to&nbsp;cope.</p><p>Being a&nbsp;mother is&nbsp;no&nbsp;picnic, especially due to&nbsp;many <a href=#>misconceptions</a> about childbearing and upbringing. It&nbsp;certainly takes a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;inner <a href=#>patience</a> and optimism to&nbsp;go&nbsp;through it&nbsp;all. In&nbsp;any case, having a&nbsp;close-knit family is&nbsp;a&nbsp;blessing, these<a href=#> people</a> can vouch for that. You get to&nbsp;<a href=#>recreate your childhood photos</a> and make cool <a href=#>tweets</a> about the funny things your kids said.</p><p>Preview photo credit A.M.P.A.S./PictureLux/agefotostock/East News<span>, </span>Associated Press/East News</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYybqZqcnJrGbq%2FOqKeeql2owaq4y2ajoq6VqHq4tdOhZKGho2K6sLmMnq2epl2ptbDBxqFkoZ1dmLy2uMNmnJqrmaHGbq7UsmShnaJirm60zq6qnmVoZn55hJho</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
