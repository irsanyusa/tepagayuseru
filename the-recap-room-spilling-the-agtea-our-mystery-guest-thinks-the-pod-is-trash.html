This episode was full of awe-inspiring talent and weird performances. This season, Talent Recap staff members will take turns talking about AGT on our new podcast, The Recap Room.</strong></p><p>The ninth episode of The Recap Room features Talent Recap video editors Julian Mejia and Olivia Gee, creative director Billy Blanks Jr., and John Doe/Unnamed Talent Recap Employee. Within the podcast, the team talks about their opinions on the eighth episode of AGT Season 18.</p><p>LISTEN HERE:</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-this-episode-sparked-plenty-of-conversation>This Episode Sparked Plenty of Conversation</h2><p>One of the staff’s favorite acts this week was Zion Clark, who shared his story of being born without legs and growing up in foster care. Olivia said she almost cried watching his performance. John Doe said he would love to see him wrestle someone in a future appearance on the show.</p><p>The staff also had plenty to say about singer Sunny Chatum, who turned out to be female comedian Krista Komondor. Julian was the only one who didn’t like the act. Olivia especially loved that the act was “so silly” and the judges were “so uncomfortable and confused.” John Doe thinks she’s a “potential winner.”</p><p>At the end of this episode of The Recap Room, John Doe tested how well the staff was paying attention to the episode by asking them to identify several quotes. Julian ended up being the winner, with two correct answers.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-the-staff-thought-of-sofia-vergara-s-golden-buzzer>What the Staff Thought of Sofia Vergara’s Golden Buzzer</h3><p>AGT judge Sofia Vergara chose to hit her Golden Buzzer for Brazilian singer Gabriel Henrique, who stunned everyone with his cover of “Run to You” by Whitney Houston. The staff agreed that Gabriel put on an incredible performance.</p><p>Olivia was especially impressed that Gabriel was able to hit the high notes that are usually associated with female divas like Mariah Carey and Ariana Grande. John Doe thought Gabriel’s ability to move people made his act extra special.</p><p>Billy pointed out how impressive it was that Gabriel needed an interpreter to interact with the judges, but he managed to sing “in perfect English.” What did you think of Sofia Vergara’s Golden Buzzer?
