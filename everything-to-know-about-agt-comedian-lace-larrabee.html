Since the judges were impressed with her hilarious jokes, she’s moved on to the brand new Qualifier Round. Here’s everything you need to know about the comedian ahead of her second performance.</strong></p><p>Lace Larrabee is an actor, stand up comic, and former southern beauty queen from Atlanta, Georgia. The 38 year old began her time on stage in pageantry, where she competed for 14 years. Once she got older, she attended and graduated from Kennesaw State University in 2010 with a Bachelors in Organizational Communication. Nearly two years after graduating college, she began performing stand up comedy.</p><p>Since performing stand up as a full time job, Lace has strived to elevate the voices of other women. In doing so, she opened Atlanta’s first and only all female stand-up comedy class, Laugh Lab. This class is taught at the Punchline Comedy Club. Although Laugh Lab was originally created as a female only group, it now offers coed classes. Atlanta Magazine voted the class as the “2019 Best Comedy Class.”</p><p>Outside of AGT, Lace currently co-hosts a podcast with fellow comedian Katherine Blanford. Their weekly podcast CHEATIES! features the comedians talking to a guest star who’s been cheated on or been the cheater. CHEATIES! focuses on relationship mistakes and how to overcome them and make it out on top.</p><p>Speaking of relationships, Lace has been married to her husband, Jarrod Harris, since April 7, 2018. According to Lace’s Facebook page, they first met in 2012 and later got engaged in 2017. Even though Lace is currently appearing on AGT, she has two comedy shows lined up for <a href=#>August</a> in North Carolina. In addition to her comedy show, CHEATIES! will be live on stage on October 16 (in Nashville, TN) and on November 12 (in Atlanta, Georgia).</p><p>Be sure to tune into America’s Got Talent on August 9 to see how Lace’s second performance. <a href=#>Voting</a> opens during Tuesday night’s show and closes at 7 a.m. ET on Wednesday.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Stefanny_Yeeremy.png alt="Meet Stefanny and Yeeremy, ‘AGT’s Dance Duo Going to the Live Shows" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xK%2Bcq7Gknbavs4ytpmajnqTEbq3BqKytZZGcwW6vzqacnaGRo3qtrcKeZKWZoqeuo7HEaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
