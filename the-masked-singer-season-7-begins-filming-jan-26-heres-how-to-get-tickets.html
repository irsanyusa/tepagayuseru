Fans of the show have been waiting to hear details on the highly anticipated new season. While the cast has not yet been revealed, we now know that it will return this spring with a live audience.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will The Masked Singer Premiere in Spring 2022?</h2><p>Season 6 of The Masked Singer pulled in 4.43 million viewers and a 0.95 rating in the 18-49 year old demographic. Even though ratings of the series were down in the fall, this show is still insanely popular. The Masked Singer is the American spin-off of the popular South Korean series King of Mask Singer. Both series put celebrities in disguise hoping that the celebrity panel will guess their identity.</p><p>Filming for The Masked Singer‘s new season begins on January 26 and concludes on Saturday, February 5. Within that period there are six days of filming. This seems like a short amount of time to make it through all of the hidden celebrities, so it’s possible they’ll release more dates in the future.</p><p>With a filming schedule like this, it’s evident that fans will not be seeing the new season until early spring. Many networks are pushing to have new series come out after the upcoming Olympics, but I’m hesitant to believe this series will be ready by February 23 due to highly graphics based the celebrity packages.</p><p>Regardless, fans can expect to see 16 (or more) new celebrity singers later this season. Although nothing has been officially confirmed by the network, fans want to see the host and panelists return for another season. Each season of this series gets even bigger, so I can’t wait to see the new celebrities behind the mask.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CY6ngoquvWY/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-can-i-get-a-ticket>When Can I Get a Ticket?</h2><p>Superfans of The Masked Singer are able to get tickets <a href=# class=broken_link>now</a>. The show is urging fans to sign up to be apart of the live audience if they are fully vaccinated. Even with proven vaccination status audience members will be required to take a COVID test 48 hours prior to their ticket date. These tests will be with the show and are free of charge. Audience members will also take a rapid test the day of taping before being able to take their seats. Tickets will have all information regarding COVID testing printed on them.</p><p>Being apart of the live audience will give you exclusive access to the upcoming season’s live performances. Fans in the audience are able to cheer live and vote on who stays under the mask. You could be apart of the team that decides who moves on and who becomes unmasked.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Doug-Kiker-American-Idol-Garbage-Man.png alt="‘American Idol’ Garbage Man Doug Kiker Stars as Himself in New Movie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>the masked singer</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>The Masked Singer season 7</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZqWRqLimsIysoKeflad6tLHArKanZWdir6azyKeqZp6ZobqqusZmoZqmXWeDbrTEq5ysZZikxG7Azmaenqxdqbakt8Stqmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
