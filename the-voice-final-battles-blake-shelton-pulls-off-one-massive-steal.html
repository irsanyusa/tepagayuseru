Blake Shelton is the only one with a steal left. And the coaches rivalry is stronger than ever before. Make sure you check out last week’s recap show where we talk about some fan-favorites in the competition plus some shocking eliminations.

Larriah Jackson (Team Gwen)</h3><p>Carter Rubin is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>just 14 years old</a> but has a very powerful voice. Larriah Jackson is an old soul with a ton of control and vocal capability for her age. Gwen chose for them to sing “Like I’m Gonna Lose You” by Meghan Trainor featuring John Legend. Blake felt that Larriah ended the song as strong as she started and John agreed. It ultimately came down to Gwen who decided that Carter was the winner of the battle. Gwen hit her save which meant Larriah isn’t going anywhere. Both Carter and Larriah are still members of Team Gwen.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3V4oSSG4ow</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ian-flanigan-vs-aaron-scott-team-blake>Ian Flanigan Vs. Aaron Scott (Team Blake)</h3><p>Ian Flanigan is a singer who performs gigs with a very deep rumbling voice. Aaron Scott is the rocker who really impressed Blake with his big range during the Blind Auditions. The pair sang “Have You Ever Seen the Rain” in a very equal matchup. John felt that Ian had a lot of identity and character in his voice. Blake chose Ian as the winner of the Battle because he has one of the most unique voices he has ever heard.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFhwavkpG24</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rio-souma-vs-casm-team-legend>Rio Souma Vs. Casmè (Team Legend)</h3><p>Both Rio Souma and Casmè sang songs by Detroit artists in their Blind Auditions so it was a no-brainer when they were paired together. She has been trying to make it as a musical artist for the past 20 years. Rio has spoken about being an openly gay artist in the music industry. The pair sang Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell’s “You’re All I Need to Get By.” Gwen complimented Rio’s “stunning” stage presence. Kelly compared Casmè to music legend Diana Ross. John said Casmè was completely on point during the performance and chose her as the winner of the battle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SK-QmX3I9nE</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>WHY REBA MCENTIRE TURNED DOWN AN OFFER TO BE A COACH ON ‘THE VOICE’</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-gallagher-vs-marisa-corvo-team-kelly>Ryan Gallagher Vs. Marisa Corvo (Team Kelly)</h3><p>Opera singer Ryan Gallagher had the coaches fighting over him during his Blind Audition. Marisa Corvo inspired audiences with her coming out story and her infectious personality. The pair sang Celine Dion’s “I Surrender.” Blake said that Marisa took over the room and John agreed that she outshined Ryan. Kelly chose Marisa as the winner of the Battle and said it was the hardest one for her to judge. As Ryan was leaving the stage, Kelly hit her save to keep Ryan in the competition. Both Ryan and Marisa are still members of Team Kelly.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykzJOmPPPwc</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-emmalee-vs-kelsie-watts-team-kelly>Emmalee Vs. Kelsie Watts (Team Kelly)</h3><p>The Voice producers then shocked us all by not showing the full Battles of some heavy-hitting performers. We only got to see a glimpse of Emmalee and Kelsie Watts going head to head. Kelsie was named the winner of the Battle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SMgIqXn444</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ben-allen-vs-sam-stacy-team-blake>Ben Allen Vs. Sam Stacy (Team Blake)</h3><p>In another huge shock country breakout artist Ben Allen also did not get his full time in the spotlight against Sam Stacy. He is one of the fan-favorites of the season. Blake chose Ben as the winner of the Battle.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-tori-miller-vs-van-andrew-team-gwen>Tori Miller Vs. Van Andrew (Team Gwen)</h3><p>Tori Miller and Van Andrew also did not get as much air time. Gwen chose Van as the winner of the Battle.</p><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>AN EPIC COUNTRY MUSIC ‘VOICE’ BATTLE ENDS WITH A SHOCKING TWIST — WATCH TARYN PAPA VS.

Ryan Berg (Team Gwen)</h3><p>Liam St. John is a smooth rocker that was paired up against the soulful gig artist Ryan Berg. They sang “I Need A Dollar” by Aloe Blacc. Kelly said that Liam is “so intense.” Blake said the Battle was tipped in Ryan’s favor even though his microphone was coming undone. Gwen said that Liam had great energy and Ryan had incredible showmanship. She chose Ryan as the winner of the Battle.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8vkxajOFNw</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-cami-clune-vs-james-pyle-team-legend>Cami Clune Vs. James Pyle (Team Legend)</h3><p>Cami was a four-chair turn with an ethereal voice in which Kelly used her block during the Blind Auditions. James is the cool singing dad that took on a Harry Styles song for his Blind Audition. The pair sang Chris Isaak’s “Wicked Game.” Blake said that he had never heard such an inventive take on a song before. John chose Cami as the winner of the Battle. However, if you remember in the beginning of the show, Blake coyly mentioned that he was the only coach that still had his steal left. He hit his steal for James which now makes James the final member of Team Blake going into the Knockouts.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZQ-2vB0C8U</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>MEET CAMI CLUNE: WHAT YOU DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT ‘THE VOICE’S VIRAL 4 CHAIR SENSATION</a></strong></p><p>Were you shocked by any of the coaches decisions during the final Battles?</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dancing-With-the-Stars-Nelly.jpg alt="‘Dancing With The Stars’ Semifinals: SO MANY Perfect Scores!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq6fnrCmecWipZqkXZeutcDLnqpmmpyWuKZ50qGcpayfo3qxwculqmanlpt6sLrEZqSaq6Oew6Z50q2cmqRf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
