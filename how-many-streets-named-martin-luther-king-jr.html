According to his 2018 <a href=#>article</a> for The Conversation, he reported that there are at least 955 streets named after King in the U.S. in 41 states, plus the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. He has <a href=#>counted</a> as many as 128 Martin Luther King Jr. thoroughfares in Georgia and found just one example in Wyoming and Alaska.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Streets increasingly started being named for King after his assassination in 1968, and even more examples could be seen after the establishment of the <a href=#>Martin Luther King Jr</a>. federal holiday in 1983. Alderman believes Chicago may be the first city to name a street named after the activist. In naming South Park Way after King—a road that runs through the predominantly Black South Side of Chicago—Mayor Richard Daley was trying to bolster the city’s reputation and perhaps court Black voters in the run-up to the <a href=#>1968 Democratic National Convention</a>, <a href=#>according to</a> American Pharaoh by Adam Cohen and Elizabeth Taylor.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While researching this topic over the last 25 years, Alderman found that streets named after King tend to be in cities where Black Americans make up at least a third of the population. These thoroughfares tend to be home to churches, government offices, schools, beauty parlors, and barber shops—spots ripe for community organizing and mutual aid. “Martin Luther King drives, boulevards, and avenues are often important centers of African American identity, activity, and community,” Alderman <a href=#>wrote</a> in a 2014 Social Education article co-authored by Jerry Mitchell.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">While in some cities there are major roads named after <a href=#>King</a>—like Austin, Albuquerque, and Tampa—Alderman found many examples on smaller streets confined to majority <a href=#>African American neighborhoods</a>. Occasionally, Alderman notes, some white business owners have voiced concerns about King streets stigmatizing the area. Alderman cites one early 1980s example of a white real estate developer in Chattanooga, Tenn., fearing that he wouldn’t be able to rent office space in a building on a street named after King because it would create <a href=#>“racial overtones.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Overall, naming streets after King can not only start conversations about whether the activist’s dreams are realized today, but also solidify his place in the pantheon of American leaders. As Alderman put it in the 2014 journal article, “The commemoration of Martin Luther King Jr. through street (re)naming is part of a larger movement to redress the exclusion of African American experiences and achievements from the national historical consciousness.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvbWVqg3h%2FjqGmsGWdlru6edKtqZ6dpKh6r63MnptmpZGnwaq6jKWsraCVp3qstc2gZKOqXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
