On the heels of his memorable Olympic commentary with Kevin Hart on the streaming service Peacock during the last Summer Games, in Tokyo in 2021—<a href=#>a clip</a> of Snoop saying a horse in the dressage competition looked like he was doing the <a href=#>crip walk went viral</a>—NBC has hired Snoop as a special correspondent for the <a href=#>Paris Games</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But as <a href=#>Snoop</a> is about to discuss the draw of the Olympics and what he hopes to deliver to audiences watching back home in the U.S., a car alarm goes off nearby. And just like any other red-blooded American trying to have an undistracted conversation on a Sunday afternoon, he pauses for a moment before flipping his lid.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Where’s the driver? Turn it off,” says Snoop Dogg, exasperated but calm. But it won’t stop – beep, beep, beep. So Snoop has had about enough.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Turn your goddamn car off!” Snoop Dogg, to my great delight, yells at his offending neighbor, my cell phone picking up the entire exchange.</p><h2 class="font-itc-franklin-gothic-std mb-5 w-full border-b border-time-gray-7 pb-5 text-center text-base font-semibold uppercase leading-tight lg:text-left">Your Guide to the Paris Olympics</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In an instant, the alarm stops, and all is quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thank you, Snoop.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Interview crisis averted, Snoop, 52, is now ready and eager to talk Olympics. With the Games now exactly a month away—opening ceremonies begin on July 26—here’s the multiplatinum rapper, producer, actor, and entrepreneur on why he first started watching the Olympics, who he’s excited to see in Paris, and a potential meetup with that crip-walking horse.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">(This interview has been edited and condensed for length and clarity)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>While growing up in Long Beach, Calif., what are some of your first Olympic memories?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Bruce Jenner and the <a href=#>Wheaties box</a>. <a href=#>Sugar Ray Leonard</a> boxing. <a href=#>Edwin Moses</a>. Things of that nature.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More: </strong><a href=#>Before There Was Caitlin Clark, There Was Jimmer Fredette</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What made you fall in love with the Games?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Back then we only had so much. It's not like right now, where you got so many different things you can watch and social media and all that sh-t. We only had TV. There was only one TV in the house, so whatever one member of the family was watching, we were all forced to watch it. The Olympics was big because it would take over the whole house whenever it would come on. And it’s special ‘cause you’re seeing athletes for the first time in three, four years and they’re representing the country. So that meant a lot, watching it as a kid.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>When NBC came to you about this gig, why did you sign on?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Why not? Not why. This is what I do, you know what I’m saying? I love being in front of the people. I love sports. I know what I'm talking about. The network is appealing enough to understand that we deserve each other. So we’re gonna make magic.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>And what do you plan to bring to NBC’s coverage that maybe we haven't seen before?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The fire and the smoke.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What do you mean by that?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">You figure it out. I’m pretty sure you've been doing this sh-t long enough to figure out what I mean by that.

And I definitely want to try to get in the water. See if I can get a 50-[second] time out of myself in the 50-meter freestyle.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I'm just a kid that's living his dream.<a href=#> I ran the 200</a> today. I wanted to do the pole vault till I seen what that sh-t looks like. I was like, ‘No way.’ I’ll try the high jump. It don’t require poles and holding [them] in the air.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">There’s things that I’m going to try. And at the same time I respect the sport and I respect the Olympics.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Do you plan to try equestrian at all?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Me and horses, I’m gonna let them dance while I talk.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>I saw somewhere that you’re going to try to meet the horse you said was crip walking in Tokyo.</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yes, I'm definitely trying to meet him. Hopefully he’s in the Olympics so I can say, ‘What’s happening?’ to him. Bring him a couple of carrots, some apples or somethin’, know what I’m saying?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=#>Fred Richard Is Team USA's Next Olympic Hope for Men's Gymnastics</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Have you been to Paris before?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yeah, many times. I’ve performed in Paris a whole bunch of times. I ran through the Arc de Triomphe. I’ve been to a lot of the big buildings out there, classic buildings from back in the day. They never change. I've been all over Paris.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What is special about the city to you?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Love. Love is in the air once you get there. You feel the love.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>How’s your French? Have you been working on it?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nah, I don’t think I have to. I think they like my language, you know what I’m sayin’? They’re going to convert to me. I’m going to translate to them what we’re talking about.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Do you think</strong><a href=#><strong> Caitlin Clark</strong></a><strong> should have been on the U.S. Olympic basketball team?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I just wish they got the best team possible. They ain’t lost in about <a href=#>18 years</a>. On the women’s side in basketball, in the Olympics, they know what they’re doing. What they said is basically, she’s great, but I don’t believe she’s gold-medal-worthy until she pulls her stuff in the WNBA.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">This is a big step from college to <a href=#>the WNBA</a>. I love what she's done for the sport in general. But you’ve got to understand, these are WNBA players that have been seasoned to do this. And when you’re going for that gold medal, you want your best girls out there.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>You just watched </strong><a href=#><strong>Sha’Carri Richardson win the 100-m title</strong></a><strong> at the U.S. Olympic trials. What do you think of Sha’Carri?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">She’s living young, wild, and free. She’s supposed to. She’s supposed to be wild. She’s supposed to be everything that she is. The setbacks set up the comeback. I love the way that she’s doing it, the way the team is supporting her, the way she’s got great people around her. She’s going to be just fine.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>She had </strong><a href=#><strong>a big setback before the last Olympics</strong></a><strong>, as she missed the Games for testing positive for cannabis, which is on the sport’s banned list. Do you think cannabis is performance-enhancing in track and field?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nah, I just ran a 34.44 in the 200 meters and I was smoking all night. So that sh-t ain’t got nothing to do with helping my time at all. It f-cked my time up, if anything. Unless they got some supersh-t to get you faster. Let me know where it is and I’ll be the first to try.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Cannabis is illegal in France, not sure if you knew that.&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Yeah, yeah. Trust me, I’m a very legal guy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Do you plan on lobbying the French government to change that while you’re over there?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Oh, nah. I plan on going out there and doing NBC Olympic work. Being clean as a book, clean as the athletes. They can test me if they want to. I’m going to be out there doing what I’m supposed to be doing to make sure I bring home the gold. Which is me.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Any international Olympians you're excited to see in Paris?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The Australian swim team, up against the Americans. They push us to the limit. And I like Jamaica’s track team. And <a href=#>Canada’s basketball team</a>. They got a shot to get to the gold-medal round, but they’re not going to win it. They got a shot ‘cause they’ve got a bunch of NBA players who are really seasoned and on top of their game. But the overall factor is going to be, the USA is the dogs. We’re not going to lose to no puppies.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What do you think of Canadian star </strong><a href=#><strong>Shai-Gilgeous Alexander</strong></a><strong> as a player?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">I think he’s the Snoop Dogg of basketball. I love the way he plays, his style. The way he stays focused and gets better every time he gets out on the court. I love his game. I respect it.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Why is he the Snoop Dogg of basketball?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Look at him</a>. He looks like me. He’s got the braids, he’s low-key, he’s the Silent Assassin.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>What is the Snoop perspective you can bring to the Games that nobody else can?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s just me. It’s hard to explain. I can't say it’s going to be a bag of potato chips, Kool-Aid, but I know it’s me. Put some plastic around me and let me come there, I do what I do. You can sell me. I’m sold.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><strong>Anything I didn't ask or you want to say before you get back to watching the trials out in Oregon?</strong></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nah, I’m just going out there to have a good time. Potpourri. Comment allez-vous. Oui oui. And all of the above.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWlmg3GDjqylqKegYrGws8ZmpqWxnaW2pL%2BMa2drbF2jr6R5yKernqqmnrK4ew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
