She previously auditioned with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">song made out of hate comments.</a> This time around, she decided to perform a cover of a song near and dear to her heart. Even though she received mixed reviews from the judges, she gave the performance her all.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-agt-star-madilyn-bailey-performs-titanium-cover-during-quarterfinals>‘AGT’ Star Madilyn Bailey Performs ‘Titanium’ Cover During Quarterfinals</h2><p>With over 8 million subscribers on YouTube, Madilyn has been one of the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">most talked about contestants</a> of the season. One of the covers that helped her shoot to fame was Sia’s “Titanium.” This was her first viral video. She decided it was the perfect song to perform in the AGT Quarterfinals.</p><p>Madilyn really wanted to show Heidi Klum a new side of her after receiving criticism during the AGT auditions. Madilyn played the piano in a gorgeous green and pink suit. Her vocals were clean and more stripped back than in her audition. This performance was simple but really let Madilyn’s voice shine. She brought Simon Cowell to his feet after the performance.</p><p>“I’ve got to be honest with you, I thought that was absolutely brilliant,” Cowell said.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>He spoke about how the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">hate comments from her AGT audition</a> have led up to this moment. He feels like this is the best thing that Madilyn could have done to silence all of the trolls out there. Cowell even went as far as to say that it “sounded like a record.”</p><p>Howie Mandel was more on the fence about the song choice. He personally resonated more with the quirkiness of Madilyn’s audition song. The mean tweets were very relatable to him when he heard it during the audition. He thought Madilyn was going to continue the trend of performing originals. Klum was also surprised to hear Madilyn sing a cover and expected her to sing an original.</p><p>AGT is all about doing the unexpected. Just because Madilyn did not perform an original does not mean her performance will not resonate with America. Now, it all comes down to the viewers votes to decide if she will make it to the AGT Semifinals.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Howie-Mandel-Gangstagrass-AGT-Howie-Mandel-AGT-Howie-Mandel-Mean-Simon-Cowell.jpeg alt="Howie Mandel Gives Harshest Critique Yet to Gangstagrass on ‘America’s Got Talent’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>America's Got Talent</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>madilyn bailey</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJqboqSpo3qjrcilnLJlo528pLfSZpimnaKesKK%2FjKCmrWWklrmmutNmoa6cl5rAbsPIrZ9mrZ6axbGxwq2cnWWjpLuoecKhpqKblWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
