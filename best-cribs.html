After interviewing her, I learned how important it is to prioritize safety and certifications on the products. She said to look for the JPMA stamp on cribs, in addition to other safety features. You can always consult a doctor for extra precaution. If you have a specific question about a baby product, you can even reach out to Jailynn McGhee, Government Affairs Standards and Certification Associate by calling (703) 299-8212 or email <a rel=nofollow href=#>jmcghee@jpma.org</a>.</p><h3>Longevity</h3><p>You can purchase cribs specifically for newborns, but a great way to stretch your crib further is to look at convertible options. Some convert from a bassinet to a toddler bed, while other options can even turn into a headboard for an adult bed down the line.</p><h3>Budget and style</h3><p>The good news is regardless of your style preferences and budget, there are plenty of options at both ends of the spectrum without having to compromise safety. Some prioritize function and high end features, while others want a stylish crib to fit into their aesthetic. My list includes it all!</p><h2 id=what-to-consider-before-buying-crib>What to consider before buying crib</h2><p>When it comes to selecting a crib, JPMA suggests purchasing one that's JPMA Certified, according to Trofe. “Our Certification Program tests more than 2,500 products annually across 29 different categories to ensure products meet the highest standards for performance and safety.” Some of the many products they certify include <a rel=alternate href=#>baby monitors</a>, <a rel=alternate href=#>high chairs</a>, and <a rel=alternate href=#>strollers</a>.</p><h3>Look at the packaging</h3><p>“When purchasing baby and children’s products like the ones mentioned above, parents and caregivers should look for the JPMA Certification Seal on the product or packaging,” suggests Trofe. “The JPMA Certification Seal signifies that the product has been tested to the most stringent standards at an independent, Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)-accredited laboratory. JPMA Certified products are tested annually to the most recent standards for even more assurance.”</p><h3>Do your research</h3><p>There are so many on the market, it’s difficult to know at first glance if a crib is JPMA certified. “Another way to find which baby and children’s products are JPMA Certified, including Full-Size Cribs, is via JPMA’s Certification Directory. To view a list of manufacturers that offer <a rel=nofollow href=#>JPMA Certified products</a>, click here and use the drop-down menu to select the product category like, “Full-Size Cribs,” then click “Continue.”</p><p>Note that if a company participates in JPMA Certification for a particular category, then all models in that category are tested and JPMA Certified,” Trofe says. “In other words, if a company is listed as certified in the “Full-Size Cribs” category, all of that company’s Full-Size Cribs—regardless of style, color, etc.—are JPMA Certified.”</p><h3>Consult an expert</h3><p>I spoke with Trofe to find out her tips on safety and what to look for in a crib. If you’re ever questioning your purchase, you can also speak to your doctor.</p><h2 id=safety-tips-for-cribs-and-safe-sleep>Safety tips for cribs and safe sleep</h2><p>When you’re researching cribs, safety is key and it’s important to look for those critical certifications attached to the product. “The safest place for baby to sleep is in a bare, JPMA Certified crib or other approved sleep product,” Trofe says. “Caregivers can consider purchasing a full-size crib that transitions to a toddler bed, and even into a full-size ’big-kid’ bed. If you select one of these convertible cribs, it’s especially important to keep the instructions and extra hardware together and in a safe place for use when it's time to transition the crib.”</p><p>Trofe adds, “Put babies on their backs for all naps and at night, use a firm, flat sleep surface, [and] never sleep with your baby. Instead of bed sharing, room share with your baby. Remove pillows, blankets, and stuffed animals from the crib when infants are sleeping. Never place additional padding under an infant, [and] always use a properly fitted mattress in baby's crib. For ease of use, install the crib mattress at the highest level when baby first comes home. When developmentally appropriate, lower the crib mattress.”</p><p>Trofe also says “don't overdress your baby, and keep the room at a comfortable temperature.” She suggests, “regularly check[ing] the crib hardware to be sure everything is appropriately tightened and secure [and to] view <a rel=nofollow href=#>JPMA's Top Tips for Safe Sleep</a> for additional recommendations on creating a safe sleep environment for baby.”</p><h2 id=best-place-to-buy-cribs>Best place to buy cribs</h2><p>I wouldn’t really say there’s a single best place to buy cribs, it’s more important to make sure they’re within safety guidelines and have certain certifications. That aside, you can look anywhere from Walmart to Amazon to Pottery Barn Kids. “When it comes to selecting a crib, JPMA suggests purchasing one that's JPMA Certified. Our Certification Program tests more than 2,500 products annually across 29 different categories to ensure products meet the highest standards for performance and safety,” Trofe said.</p><p>She adds, “One of those categories is Full-Size Cribs, and similar Certified categories include <a rel=alternate href=#>crib mattresses</a>, bedside sleepers, <a rel=alternate href=#>bassinets</a>/cradles, play yards, toddler beds, and even portable bed rails—meaning your baby can have a sleep surface that's JPMA Certified from the newborn stage through toddlerhood.”</p><h2 id=care-and-maintenance-of-cribs>Care and maintenance of cribs</h2><p>It’s important to take care and maintain the crib for safety so the crib lasts a long time. “When setting up and using the crib or other sleep products, always follow the manufacturer’s instructions, including warning labels and requirements for age, developmental milestones, height, and weight,” Trofe suggests. “If instructions or hardware are misplaced, find the crib’s model number, and call the manufacturer’s/brand’s customer service number to request instructions and replacement parts. Never use hardware that isn’t provided by the manufacturer, as it could impact the safety of the product.”</p><h2 id=frequently-asked-questions-faqs>Frequently asked questions (FAQs)</h2><h3>What is the safest crib?</h3><p>There’s not one crib that’s necessarily the “safest,” but more so guidelines you can follow to help keep your baby safe and protected. When it comes “to selecting a safe crib, JPMA recommends ALWAYS following safe sleep practices for baby. Keep these tips in mind,” suggests Trofe. “Know what products are best when baby is asleep: Bassinets and cradles, play yards, cribs, bedside sleepers, and toddler beds (if developmentally appropriate). Baby products designed and marketed for sleep can be used for supervised and unsupervised sleep, including naps and overnight sleep.”</p><p>For cribs, you’ll also want to ensure the mattress fits tightly, not leaving any room between it and the rails so your baby can’t get trapped. Getting a GREENGUARD Gold certified crib is also ideal to reduce your baby’s exposure to chemicals like volatile organic compounds (VOCs). And following instructions diligently based on the particular crib purchased for your child when setting it up can help to prevent any unforeseen accidents.</p><p>When it comes to safety, hang on to those instructions (especially when going through <a rel=alternate href=#>baby gifts</a>) about registering your products for safety updates. “To ensure you are always using safe products for your child, including cribs, JPMA encourages you to register any new products you purchase or receive. Your product packaging should have a pre-paid registration card that you can complete and mail back to the manufacturer.”</p><h3>What should you avoid when buying a crib?</h3><p>According to <a rel=nofollow href=#>Nemours Kids Health</a>, avoid buying a crib pre-used crib with a drop rail. It’s safer for the baby if the side rails don’t move. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) actually stopped allowing the sale of drop-side rails because they found these cribs could be dangerous. It’s also important to avoid purchasing a mattress that’s too soft. Try it out and make sure it’s firm enough to support your baby and avoid any potential risk of sudden infant death syndrome. Be sure that the slats distance have a safe distance between them (2-3/8 inches maximum) to be sure the child can’t get through them and get hurt. Check the safety certifications attached to each crib, and baby product in general, to be sure they’re <a rel=nofollow href=#>non-toxic</a>, and safe for your baby.</p><p>Avoid forgetting to register your product with the manufacturer. If you remember to do this, you can get important information on recalls and more. “Through product registration, parents can establish a direct line of communication with the manufacturer should a problem arise with a product purchased,” Trofe says. “If there is a safety announcement or recall associated with that product, the manufacturer can contact you directly to provide further details on what to do with the recalled product. Although recalls are announced and promoted in various ways, parents can miss public announcements. Product registration cards are an easy way for information to be provided to parents directly and efficiently.”</p><h3>How much should I spend on a crib?</h3><p>This really just depends on your budget, aesthetic, and design preferences. Many of the inexpensive cribs under $200 have the same safety regulations as the ones that are over $1000. The only thing you should prioritize is safety certifications. Beyond that, you can just look at the features that are important to you and your own personal budget.</p><h3>Should a crib be against a wall?</h3><p>“When it comes to placing a crib safely in a room, you can place it against a wall, but you’ll want to ensure you place it away from windows, heaters, wall lamps, drapes, and blind cords,” Trofe said. “Additionally, you’ll want to place monitors or anything with cords at least three feet away from any part of the crib.
