While the actor usually keeps a&nbsp;low profile when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;his personal life, he&nbsp;revealed in&nbsp;2017 that he&nbsp;became a&nbsp;father through adoption. The proud dad shared the things that led to&nbsp;the decision that forever changed his life.</p><p><h2>1. Hill decided to&nbsp;pursue an&nbsp;acting career despite having a&nbsp;doctorate in&nbsp;law.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/84f/338/58fa8c55099a4503bcc271473b.jpg><p><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Francis Eugene Harper</a> was born on&nbsp;May&nbsp;17, 1966, in&nbsp;Iowa City to&nbsp;a&nbsp;psychiatrist father and anesthesiologist mother. He&nbsp;later adopted the name “Hill” to&nbsp;honor both his maternal and paternal ancestors. Hill Harper took an&nbsp;interest in&nbsp;acting very early in&nbsp;his life, starting at&nbsp;the age of&nbsp;7.</p><p>Despite knowing since childhood what he&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;do, <strong>Hill went on&nbsp;to&nbsp;earn 3&nbsp;Ivy League degrees, including a&nbsp;doctorate in&nbsp;law from Harvard.</strong> He&nbsp;only started pursuing acting full time in&nbsp;1993, when he&nbsp;landed a&nbsp;role in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Married... with Children</i></a><i>. </i>Hill’s most famous roles include Sheldon Hawkes in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>CSI: NY</i></a>&nbsp;and Dr. Marcus Andrews in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Good Doctor</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><h2>2. He&nbsp;was diagnosed with cancer and overcame the disease.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/465/ba2/b2396c53d6b633469ab5176dbf.jpg><p>The actor was diagnosed with <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>thyroid cancer</a> after he&nbsp;woke up&nbsp;one day and “couldn’t swallow anything.” Thankfully, the disease was caught early on&nbsp;and Harper got treated right away. Although the star had his thyroid removed, he&nbsp;made a&nbsp;full recovery and got discharged with a&nbsp;clean bill of&nbsp;health. “<strong>We&nbsp;think we&nbsp;have all the time in&nbsp;the world, but a&nbsp;cancer diagnosis definitely makes you take stock of&nbsp;your own mortality</strong>,<strong>”</strong> Harper said about his health battle.</p><p><h2>3. His mom inspired him to&nbsp;adopt his son.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f5/cd5/d201085d0592d67204fc0ef0f2.jpg><p>Hill Harper’s <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mother</a>, Marilyn, was very supportive of&nbsp;her son’s decision to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;father. Hill also credits his mom with giving the final push to&nbsp;adopt the baby. <strong>“I&nbsp;needed help to&nbsp;make that decision, and it&nbsp;was her guidance and her wisdom and her love and support that helped me&nbsp;get there.” </strong>Marilyn also helped the first-time dad with caring for the child.</p><p><h2>4. He&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;single dad by&nbsp;choice at&nbsp;49.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e0f/61b/0eab4453cdab127b58c44d18a7.jpg><p>In&nbsp;2015, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Good Doctor</i></a> star received a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>call</a> that would forever change his life for the better. “<strong>[Adopting Pierce] was the greatest decision I’ve ever made and I’ve never been happier,</strong>”<strong> </strong>Hill said in&nbsp;an&nbsp;exclusive interview in&nbsp;2017. A&nbsp;few days before Thanksgiving, his attorney told the actor that a&nbsp;woman who was going to&nbsp;give birth wanted to&nbsp;give the baby up&nbsp;for adoption.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/eb6/623/cc8f6258d9b3852ecd43fa0b4c.jpg><p>After meeting his son’s birth mom, Hill’s fears about becoming a&nbsp;dad disappeared and the actor felt like <strong>the child had chosen him to&nbsp;be&nbsp;his </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>parent</strong></a><strong>. </strong>The actor was also present in&nbsp;the delivery room, witnessing the baby’s birth and even cutting the umbilical cord.</p><p>“I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;scared,” the actor recalled a&nbsp;few years later. “I&nbsp;think because it&nbsp;was such a&nbsp;huge decision. But looking back now, all the fears&nbsp;I had were ridiculously small compared to&nbsp;the joy of&nbsp;having him in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life and having the opportunity to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;father, Harper said. “<strong>I&nbsp;had never really changed a&nbsp;</strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><strong>diaper</strong></a><strong> in&nbsp;my&nbsp;life</strong>.”<strong> </strong>Harper opened&nbsp;up, admitting that although challenging, taking care of&nbsp;a&nbsp;newborn filled his life with purpose.</p><p><h2>5. He&nbsp;named his son after his good friend, Pierce Brosnan.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7f7/66a/b68fb954cf82cd0d61677ea9e0.jpg><p>Hill Harper and <a href=# title="Pierce Brosnan" data-link=tag>Pierce Brosnan</a> met in&nbsp;1998&nbsp;on the set of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Nephew</i></a> and have been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>close friends</a> ever since. When adopting his son, Hill decided to&nbsp;name him after the <a href=# title="James Bond" data-link=tag>James Bond</a> actor. “I&nbsp;did a&nbsp;movie years ago with Pierce Brosnan and he&nbsp;and&nbsp;I have been friends ever since, and <strong>he’s one of&nbsp;the classiest, smartest, most beautiful humans in&nbsp;the world.</strong> If&nbsp;my&nbsp;son can be&nbsp;anything like him...” the actor explained in&nbsp;an&nbsp;interview.</p><p><h2>6. He&nbsp;always strives to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the best dad for Pierce.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d91/3a6/c98231507ea4de8dd04a62c1b1.jpg><p>Little Pierce Hill Harper will turn <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>7&nbsp;years old</a> on&nbsp;December&nbsp;19, 2022, and his dad is&nbsp;making sure that he&nbsp;has the best childhood possible. Pierce often makes an&nbsp;appearance on&nbsp;the actor’s Instagram account. Meanwhile, Hill Harper continues to&nbsp;pursue acting and will appear on&nbsp;season 6&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>The Good Doctor</i></a>, premiering in&nbsp;October.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/21e/8c7/f87a7b58f285fa82e533ded74e.jpg><p>Although Hill admits that raising a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>little human</a> all on&nbsp;his own can be&nbsp;challenging, he’s also very glad he&nbsp;didn’t wait any longer to&nbsp;become a&nbsp;father. “Every day you’re making a&nbsp;different set of&nbsp;decisions that you feel impact the future of&nbsp;this wonderful person,” he&nbsp;said. “That’s a&nbsp;challenge.<strong> It’s a&nbsp;beautiful challenge but it’s a&nbsp;challenge.</strong>”</p><p>Furthermore, raising a&nbsp;child as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single dad brought with it&nbsp;another set of&nbsp;hurdles too. “<strong>I&nbsp;never realized how mom-centric everything&nbsp;is. In&nbsp;every book, everything is&nbsp;like, ’my mom, my&nbsp;mom,’ </strong>and it&nbsp;always made me&nbsp;feel some kind of&nbsp;way because of&nbsp;Pierce not having that traditional mom in&nbsp;his life,” the actor said, candidly. But from hiring a&nbsp;baby coach and joining a&nbsp;group of&nbsp;moms in&nbsp;need of&nbsp;breastmilk to&nbsp;asking his mom for advice, Harper did everything to&nbsp;make sure his son got the care that he&nbsp;deserves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYygpqicXZm8pMDOq2SsrJGneqm1y6VkoZmipbKzedKhmKudo2LEqa3TZqCtZZ2arq%2B%2FjK2mZpqVmLyusYyaZKyhnpy5pnnDmptmmaRigXp506GpqK2XnXqisM6pq6KnnmKFcYSWcGto</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
