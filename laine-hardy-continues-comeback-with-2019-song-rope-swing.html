The song, entitled “Rope Swing” was originally written back in 2019. Fans were excited to hear Hardy sing this tune on social media.</strong></p><p>Fans can’t help but expect a comeback from American Idol season 17 winner Laine Hardy. The singer has been seen posting songs to Instagram following his May 2022 arrest. If you missed it, Hardy was arrested and accused of bugging a Louisiana State University student’s dorm room earlier this year. At the time, the singer revealed to social media that he was cooperating with police.</p><p>Since the arrest, Hardy has slowly returned to both music and social media. He’s been seen singing “Me Meeting You” as well as “Party I Can Play.” On September 24, Hardy posted his most recent song to social media. The song, entitled “Rope Swing” is about reminiscing about a past summer with a girl.</p><p>The song has received positive feedback from Instagram fans. Some have even requested the singer to officially release the song to streaming.</p><p>“Great song. Glad you’re back at it. Keep singing, you have a unique voice & so much talent,” a fan wrote.</p><p>Other fans have also wished the singer well, while other comments mention Hardy’s legal issues. They state that they hope he sorts out his legal troubles soon.</p><p>Hardy has not yet posted any statements regarding the legal troubles he has been dealing with. What’s for sure is that Hardy is posting more often lately, probably out of desire to return to his music career.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Hardy Appeared as a Special Guest in a Show Recently</h2><p>Last month, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hardy</a> made a guest appearance at the 2022 Great Darke County Fair. He was the opening act with fellow singer and Award-winning country music artist Riley Green. Hardy was able to step on stage again playing alongside Nashville’s number one recording artist.</p><p>Following their successful concert, a collaboration between the two would greatly help Hardy get back on track. Currently, there are no new song releases from the two singers.</p><p>Once Hardy has been able to manage his legal issues, returning to the stage would not be a problem. Hardy said before that, “my entire world belongs to my music and my fans,” so an eventual comeback is possible.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Original_SamChampion_CherylBurke_Premiere_ABC_Eric-McCandless.jpg alt="Cheryl Burke, Sam Champion Dealing with ‘DWTS’ Injuries" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>laine hardy</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y5qgp51dna6zsNhmmqimpJ67trHSZpqopZWXrqS3jLCgraBdZ31yhYyspqefXae8sbGMrK6ippdk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
