He had barely a year left.</p><p>“Rock considered dying with grace to be his finest performance,” Porter wrote. “When he could no longer hide it he admitted that he had AIDS and put a beloved face to what was then a terrifying plague.</p><p>"He spent his final days looking out across his beautiful garden, facing his demise with courage. His death united Hollywood against the disease that killed him, a legacy he could be proud of."</p><p>Hudson changed global perceptions about the AIDS epidemic by revealing his own diagnosis in July 1985. It is said that his disclosure pushed his former Hollywood friend, President <a href=#>Ronald Reagan</a>, into finally mentioning AIDS publicly for the first time in September 1985.</p><p>Reagan had faced criticism from the gay community and medical experts for being slow to respond to the epidemic that had resulted in 15,527 AIDS cases and 12,529 deaths by the end of 1985.</p><p>But after Hudson’s demise, Congress allocated $221 million to find a cure for the disease, and donations to AIDS charities soared.</p><p>Rock Hudson’s most famous on-screen partnership came in the Sixties when he co-starred with <a href=#>Doris Day</a> in three highly successful romantic comedies – Pillow Talk, Lover Come Back and Send Me No Flowers.</p><p>Day, who died aged 97 in May, 2019, gave an interview with People magazine four years earlier in which she told how she saw Hudson just before he went public with his diagnosis. Both she and the rest of the world were startled by his gaunt appearance at a news conference to announce their reunion for her variety show.</p><p>“I hardly knew him,” Day recalled to People. “He was very sick. But I just brushed that off and I came out and put my arms around him and said, ‘Am I glad to see you!'”</p><p>Day also said Hudson got very tired and couldn’t eat when she prepared him a meal: “I’d say, ‘What if I get a fork and feed you?’ but he said, ‘Doris, I can’t eat.'”</p><p>Day told People she last saw him just before he boarded a small plane to fly home. “We kissed goodbye and he gave me a big hug and he held on to me,” she said. “I was in tears. That was the last time I saw him – but he’s in heaven now.”</p><p><b>Published:</b> <i>August 23, 2019</i><br><b>Updated:</b> <i>October 2, 2021</i></p><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Articles on Events in October</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGiYq6yZmLmmv46tn55lpKeuqLXCZpinnF2brrWty2aqnpuimsFuu8Vmqaibm2K1trDSqKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
