I’ve already faced this problem as&nbsp;a&nbsp;teenager. I’ve spent a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time trying to&nbsp;repair&nbsp;it, using many methods. But finally, I’ve found a&nbsp;solution.</p><p><strong>Bright Side</strong>’s author wants to&nbsp;share her hair repair story and hopes that it’ll help those who want their hair to&nbsp;become healthy again.</p><p><h2>This process isn’t about miracles. It’s about constant work and everyday care.</h2></p><p>Unfortunately, I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;burst your bubble if&nbsp;you’re hoping to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;universal formula that will repair your hair within 1&nbsp;week. No&nbsp;one keeps this precious information secret. It&nbsp;simply doesn’t exist.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/24b/7c6/badf1a538f85750f13e78de9a7.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>I&nbsp;spent 5&nbsp;years trying to&nbsp;get the long and healthy hair that we&nbsp;usually see in&nbsp;ads. I&nbsp;started with having no&nbsp;clue about the nature of&nbsp;hair and having too many myths in&nbsp;my&nbsp;head. I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;experiment a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;find useful and useless methods. You can see the result in&nbsp;the picture on&nbsp;the right.</p><p>Of&nbsp;course, lots of&nbsp;things depend on&nbsp;the structure and thickness of&nbsp;your hair. In&nbsp;other words, everything depends on&nbsp;your genes. But I’m sure that if&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;good approach, you’ll see the results in&nbsp;3-4 months regardless of&nbsp;your hair type.</p><p><h2>Feature #1: Everyday hair care won’t help it&nbsp;grow faster.</h2></p><p>Hair care and hair growth don’t depend on&nbsp;each other. But <strong>proper care can make already-grown hair beautiful and strong. It&nbsp;can also prevent you from having premature hair loss.</strong> There’s no&nbsp;difference between an&nbsp;extremely expensive mask and a&nbsp;mask made with special ingredients from someone’s great-grandmother. Almost all hair care products have only 2&nbsp;functions: to&nbsp;clean and protect already existing hair.</p><p><h2>When I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;take proper care of&nbsp;my&nbsp;hair, I&nbsp;was surprised by&nbsp;the fact that we&nbsp;know so&nbsp;little about the simplest care rules.</h2></p><p>Below, you won’t find any brand new methods, but you’ll be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;compare them to&nbsp;your current hair care practices. To&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, I&nbsp;failed to&nbsp;observe each of&nbsp;these tips.</p><ul><li><strong>Don’t torment your hair, <a href=# title=brushing data-link=tag>brushing</a> it&nbsp;100 times a&nbsp;day.</strong> It&nbsp;doesn’t work and it&nbsp;can damage your hair. This <a href=#>myth</a> likely started decades ago before high-quality products existed. In&nbsp;the past, people had to&nbsp;brush their hair to&nbsp;clean&nbsp;it, similar to&nbsp;how you would beat the dust out of&nbsp;a&nbsp;rug. By&nbsp;brushing your hair too often, you damage your hair’s structure. Use a&nbsp;brush only when you really need&nbsp;it. By&nbsp;the way, it’s really useful to&nbsp;brush your hair right before washing&nbsp;it.</li><li><strong>Water should be&nbsp;warm, not cold or&nbsp;hot.</strong> We&nbsp;all know that hot water makes our hair brittle. But many people still believe cold water makes our hair shiny. <a href=#>Trichologists</a> say that the only way to&nbsp;truly add shine is&nbsp;to&nbsp;smoothen your outer hair cuticle. Cold water doesn’t have any great superpowers, but you can use a&nbsp;post-shampoo <a href=# title=conditioner data-link=tag>conditioner</a> instead.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/da3/776/49dee458b98e8968180c83250f.jpg><ul><li><strong>When you wash your hair, you have to&nbsp;apply <a href=# title=shampoo data-link=tag>shampoo</a> to&nbsp;the scalp and roots. </strong>Don’t wash the whole length on&nbsp;purpose. First, the longer your hair&nbsp;is, the more it&nbsp;gets tangled. Second, there’s only dust on&nbsp;your hair (except for the roots) that can be&nbsp;easily washed away with water mixed with the shampoo that flows down while you wash your roots.</li><li><strong>You should apply a&nbsp;conditioner or&nbsp;a&nbsp;mask to&nbsp;moisten, not wet, your hair.</strong> When you rinse your hair, gently wring it&nbsp;and wipe it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;towel. Keep in&nbsp;mind that the wet hair is&nbsp;really vulnerable. If&nbsp;you wring your hair out too hard, you’ll damage&nbsp;it, but if&nbsp;you don’t wipe it&nbsp;thoroughly, your product won’t be&nbsp;absorbed.</li></ul><p>I&nbsp;usually apply my&nbsp;products with my&nbsp;fingers, though different sources recommend to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it&nbsp;with a&nbsp;brush. But let me&nbsp;repeat: the wet hair is&nbsp;really vulnerable, so&nbsp;I recommend to&nbsp;take your time and do&nbsp;everything with your own 2&nbsp;hands.</p><ul><li><strong>Losing clumps of&nbsp;hair in&nbsp;the shower is&nbsp;normal. </strong>The life cycle of&nbsp;a&nbsp;strand of&nbsp;hair consists of&nbsp;several <a href=#>stages</a>. The last one is&nbsp;telogen. It&nbsp;lasts 2-3 months and then it&nbsp;falls out. Thus, those hairs you lose while taking a&nbsp;shower are hairs that our body wants to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;to&nbsp;let our follicles grow new ones. On&nbsp;average, we&nbsp;lose around 100-150 hairs a&nbsp;day.</li></ul><p>It’s absolutely fine that our hair starts falling out faster during certain seasons. As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, it&nbsp;happens in&nbsp;autumn when our body restarts all processes. Don’t panic, it’s a&nbsp;natural phenomenon that ends in&nbsp;3&nbsp;months.</p><ul><li><strong>“Washing your hair every day damages&nbsp;it,”</strong> and <strong>“You only have to&nbsp;wait and then your hair will get used to&nbsp;it&nbsp;and won’t get dirty so&nbsp;fast,”</strong> are <strong>harmful tips.</strong> First, it’s impossible to&nbsp;“re-train” your hair: sebum secretion is&nbsp;connected with body processes and hormones.</li></ul><p>Second, the <a href=#>belief</a> that frequent shampooing is&nbsp;bad for your hair and scalp has a&nbsp;real but irrelevant reason. The first shampoos contained aggressive washing components, but modern shampoos are absolutely safe for everyday use.</p><p>If&nbsp;you use styling products, live in&nbsp;a&nbsp;polluted area, or&nbsp;often wear a&nbsp;hat, it’s recommended to&nbsp;wash your hair every day or&nbsp;no&nbsp;less than every 3&nbsp;days. Otherwise, you’re likely to&nbsp;cause scalp <a href=#>diseases</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dc3/a8f/d139aa5180b3e23e1ae96a1c10.jpg><ul><li><strong>Don’t avoid using a&nbsp;spray conditioner</strong>, especially if&nbsp;you have thin hair. Problematic hair can get tangled even if&nbsp;you use a&nbsp;mask. Additionally, a&nbsp;spray helps to&nbsp;deal with static hair better than water.</li></ul><p>For a&nbsp;long time, I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;avoid using sprays as&nbsp;I thought they’d make my&nbsp;hair heavier. I&nbsp;tried to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;tangled hair using my&nbsp;fingers, water, and brushes. It&nbsp;usually ended the same way: I&nbsp;cut those clumps out. If&nbsp;you still think that leave-in conditioners are a&nbsp;waste of&nbsp;money, believe&nbsp;me, you’re wrong.</p><ul><li><strong>The quality of&nbsp;your brush matters. </strong>If&nbsp;you don’t have the opportunity to&nbsp;buy several different brushes, 1&nbsp;wide brush with natural bristles will be&nbsp;enough for everyday use&nbsp;— it’s really great for daily care.</li></ul><p><h2>I&nbsp;experimented with homemade and purchased products.</h2></p><p>At&nbsp;the beginning of&nbsp;my&nbsp;journey, I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;fan of&nbsp;natural products: I&nbsp;made all hair care treatments on&nbsp;my&nbsp;own, saved tons of&nbsp;recipes, and quit buying products in&nbsp;stores as&nbsp;I thought they were harmful. But in&nbsp;fact, it&nbsp;was harmful to&nbsp;have no&nbsp;clue about the problem itself.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/acc/c27/a07a415b6d9c7d256cfe1d33b9.jpg><p class=adme-img-description>Hairs’ ends are the driest and most vulnerable. In&nbsp;the picture, you can see the way they look when you use a&nbsp;<a href=# title=handmade data-link=tag>handmade</a> soap.</p><p>For example, I&nbsp;thought store-bought shampoos were the root of&nbsp;evil and washed my&nbsp;hair with handmade soaps or&nbsp;coal-tar soaps, and even tried to&nbsp;make shampoo on&nbsp;my&nbsp;own. This shampoo failed to&nbsp;wash my&nbsp;hair properly and managed to&nbsp;destroy&nbsp;it.</p><p>First, handmade soap doesn’t mean it’s made from high-quality ingredients and it’s not guaranteed that the person who produces it&nbsp;uses certified and safe dyes, fragrances, thickeners, and so&nbsp;on. A&nbsp;coal-tar soap may be&nbsp;prescribed in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;some diseases as&nbsp;it&nbsp;has a&nbsp;strong drying effect. Just imagine what it&nbsp;does to&nbsp;thin and brittle hair.</p><p>Due to&nbsp;its high alkali content, any soap dries out your skin and hair, worsens their condition, and destroys the structure of&nbsp;the hair. Doctors <a href=#>don’t recommend</a> using it&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;modern shampoos.</p><p><h2>A homemade mask vs a purchased one</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2f9/355/1e58f259c1b4f7ad52e201ecac.jpg><p>I&nbsp;used to&nbsp;make masks on&nbsp;my&nbsp;own too. But I&nbsp;can’t say they’re better than store-bought ones.</p><ul><li>It&nbsp;takes you more time to&nbsp;rinse them out.</li><li>Their “natural” effect is&nbsp;overrated: even if&nbsp;you buy all the ingredients, you can’t be&nbsp;sure they’re all of&nbsp;good quality. For example, I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;buy eggs, vegetables, and fruit in&nbsp;stores as&nbsp;I don’t have a&nbsp;farm.</li><li>Not all masks are harmless. It&nbsp;may depend on&nbsp;your hair structure, but my&nbsp;thin hair got really tangled and&nbsp;I couldn’t brush it&nbsp;properly. And those masks that were fine for my&nbsp;hair didn’t give that “wow” effect.</li></ul><p><h2>Why does it&nbsp;look like our hair grows faster when we&nbsp;use masks?</h2></p><p>Because masks make our hair look better! Moistened hair becomes smooth and shiny.</p><p>When you cut your hairs’ ends, you get the same “growth effect.” The thing&nbsp;is, when our hairs’ ends are of&nbsp;the same length and structure, our hairstyle looks healthier. That’s why the myth that we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;cut our ends from time to&nbsp;time exists.</p><p>It&nbsp;doesn’t mean we&nbsp;haven’t cut our hair at&nbsp;all: we&nbsp;have to&nbsp;take care of&nbsp;the whole length of&nbsp;the hair. Just remember that ends need more moistening than the scalp. As&nbsp;for cutting the ends, you can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;once every 3-6 months depending on&nbsp;your hair growth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b06/1f8/562024509f8929c8c36e60e0fd.jpg><p>I&nbsp;recommend that you be&nbsp;careful with oils: they can be&nbsp;harmful. If&nbsp;you have any diseases (even dandruff), oils can worsen the situation.</p><p>If&nbsp;your scalp is&nbsp;fine and you only want to&nbsp;moisten it&nbsp;with oils, it’s not a&nbsp;good idea as&nbsp;it’s difficult to&nbsp;rinse oils out. For example, I&nbsp;can do&nbsp;it&nbsp;only with the help of&nbsp;a&nbsp;soap which is&nbsp;also harmful as&nbsp;we&nbsp;already know. Instead of&nbsp;pure oils, <a href=#>experts </a>recommend using gentler products containing oils.</p><p>I’d like to&nbsp;add that aloe vera gel is&nbsp;the perfect product to&nbsp;nourish your scalp. You can buy it&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=#>make</a> it&nbsp;with your own 2&nbsp;hands.</p><p><h2>Are modern store-bought products really harmful?</h2></p><p>They’re not harmful if&nbsp;you’re aware of&nbsp;their features. For example, due to&nbsp;my&nbsp;urge to&nbsp;use ecologically-friendly products, I’ve decided to&nbsp;buy natural makeup products only. But you have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;careful with them: some manufacturers try to&nbsp;fool&nbsp;us by&nbsp;using beautiful brand names.</p><p>I&nbsp;recommend to&nbsp;always read the ingredients of&nbsp;a&nbsp;product before buying&nbsp;it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/e1f/b93/c17bbf508ea3ba9012c00e9179.jpg><p>Ingredients are the main reason why&nbsp;I stopped using most store-bought care products. And it’s not because of&nbsp;synthetic components (they also appear in&nbsp;eco-friendly cosmetics); the thing&nbsp;is, some of&nbsp;them aren’t safe.</p><p>As&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule, I&nbsp;take a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;the ingredients of&nbsp;products&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;buy, go&nbsp;home, and check each component. If&nbsp;there’s a&nbsp;majority of&nbsp;non-synthetic ingredients and the artificial ingredients aren’t harmful or&nbsp;prohibited in&nbsp;other countries, I’ll buy the product. I&nbsp;usually check other products of&nbsp;the particular brand and if&nbsp;their ingredients are fine, I&nbsp;trust&nbsp;it.</p><p><h2>Outlining the main points:</h2></p><p>1. Before dealing with hair growth, make sure your hair is&nbsp;healthy. Keep taking care of&nbsp;it&nbsp;all the time.</p><p>2. To&nbsp;solve a&nbsp;hair growth problem or&nbsp;cure any scalp disease, turn to&nbsp;a&nbsp;trichologist. You’ll likely need to&nbsp;visit an&nbsp;endocrinologist, a&nbsp;psychologist, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;nutritionist depending on&nbsp;your current state, but a&nbsp;trichologist is&nbsp;a&nbsp;must.</p><p>3. Learn some information about the products you use. There’s a&nbsp;chance that you’ll need to&nbsp;replace them with products of&nbsp;better quality.</p><p>4. Increase your knowledge: science is&nbsp;always changing. Use it&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;safe and sound.</p><p>Will you try any of&nbsp;these tips? Have you found this article useful?
