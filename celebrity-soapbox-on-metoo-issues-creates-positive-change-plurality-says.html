Forty-one percent of GOP adults said the behavior has created negative change in society, while 7 percent of Democrats said the same.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Celebrities used awards shows such as the Golden Globes and the Oscars during last year’s awards season to call attention to issues of gender inequality and sexual misconduct in the industry, promoting the #MeToo movement and Time’s Up, an organization founded by Hollywood celebrities that advocates for gender parity and seeks to support women experiencing workplace sexual misconduct. At last year’s Golden Globes, nominees and presenters wore <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>pins displaying the organization’s name</a>, while winners such as Frances McDormand and Laura Dern <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>used their acceptance speeches</a> to call attention to important social issues. On the red carpet, #MeToo founder Tarana Burke <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>walked alongside</a> actress Michelle Williams.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">While the entertainment industry is still doing its part to highlight the problems of sexual harassment and pay disparity, 53 percent say sexual harassment is a major problem in Hollywood -- a higher share than politics (47 percent), finance (36 percent) and the tech industry (30 percent). The share who noted sexual harassment as a major problem in entertainment was 7 percentage points higher than those who said it was a major problem for society overall.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Even with continued media coverage of #MeToo and Time’s Up’s efforts to combat harassment in the workplace, only 15 percent of those surveyed say that sexual harassment has become less of a problem in Hollywood in the past year. A 39 percent plurality said the issue in the entertainment industry has not changed -- roughly equal to the share of survey respondents who said celebrities speaking out about sexual misconduct created positive change in society overall, suggesting Hollywood may have some way to go in improving perceptions of the industry.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In late 2017, it was revealed that actor Mark Wahlberg <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>earned $1.5 million for reshoots</a> of the film “All the Money in the World” compared to the less-than $1,000 his co-star, Michelle Williams earned, highlighting the pay gap between men and women in Hollywood.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">Forty percent of respondents felt that the gender wage gap was a major problem in society in general, and 37 percent felt it was a major problem in Hollywood specifically. Forty-eight percent of respondents indicated that they felt the wage gap in Hollywood had not changed in the past year, compared to 49 percent of respondents who said the issue had not changed in society overall in the past year.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">As the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements continue to highlight issues of gender inequality and sexual misconduct, those surveyed indicate that the #MeToo movement is the one they are most familiar with, as 65 percent of respondents said that they had heard “a lot” or “some” about the <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>movement founded in 2006</a>. However, only 22 percent of adults said they had heard a lot or some about Time’s Up, <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>the organization</a> that emerged from women in the entertainment industry last year and expanded beyond Hollywood -- including the creation of the Time’s Up Legal Defense Fund, which helps defray costs for those pursuing legal action after experiencing sexual harassment in the workplace nationwide.</p><p class="mb-m last:mb-0 text-body-large">In a <a class="items-center outline-2 outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-brand cursor-pointer hover:underline underline text-primary hover:text-primary-900 visited:text-primary-900" tabindex=0 href=#>letter</a> released on the one-year anniversary of Time’s Up, the organization acknowledged that while 2018 was “a record year for women,” progress is still needed, and Time’s Up X2, a new initiative, will work to “double the number of women in leadership and across other spaces where women are underrepresented.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiooqR7rrvRp6Cnn5Oku7TBy61lnKedZK6zwMico56rX5iyrbHBq6CtsV2ovKK8waivZqeeYrqmwM6oZKKro6qytHnCq5yarJWoerG70qKroq6VYrCprc2gnGaonKq%2ForjIrbBmq5GuwA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
