<span class=val><a href=./categories/blog>blog</a></span></div><h1 class=headline itemprop=headline>Married for Almost 40 Years After Being Rejected Twice by His Wife, Denzel Washingtons Story Show</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><p>They’ve been together for nearly 4&nbsp;decades&nbsp;— Denzel and Pauletta Washington, one of&nbsp;<a href=# title=Hollywood data-link=tag>Hollywood</a>’s most solid couples, will celebrate 39&nbsp;years together this year and are on&nbsp;the verge of&nbsp;their ruby wedding anniversary. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;also to&nbsp;their credit that they have stood firm in&nbsp;the face of&nbsp;the challenges that fame can bring. But not only that, the value of&nbsp;this <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> was clear from the beginning, as&nbsp;Pauletta did not make it&nbsp;easy for Denzel, who knew how to&nbsp;persevere.</p><p>At&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong>, we&nbsp;<a href=# title=love data-link=tag>love</a> romantic stories, even more so&nbsp;if&nbsp;they involve succeeding in&nbsp;things such as&nbsp;meeting your significant other. That’s why we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;share Denzel and Pauletta Washington’s story, one that proves how being persistent can make love last.</p><p>Firm, proud, confident, and committed&nbsp;— this is&nbsp;how we&nbsp;can see the partnership formed by&nbsp;Pauletta and Denzel Washington, who are about to&nbsp;celebrate spending 4&nbsp;decades together next year. Their relationship was not easy at&nbsp;the beginning, and it&nbsp;hasn’t been over the years, as&nbsp;both agree that their strength lies in&nbsp;their principles and work. As&nbsp;Denzel <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>put</a>&nbsp;it, “I&nbsp;just think you have to&nbsp;work at&nbsp;it. Don’t give up&nbsp;on&nbsp;each other. It’s a&nbsp;commitment.”</p><p>Pauletta and Denzel met in&nbsp;the late 1970s on&nbsp;the set of&nbsp;the&nbsp;TV movie, <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Wilma</i></a>. After that, they started dating. Pauletta told <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Oprah</a> some fun facts about the beginning of&nbsp;their relationship: “A&nbsp;mutual friend, who was also in&nbsp;the movie, had thrown a&nbsp;party. And Denzel and his friends arrived at&nbsp;the end of&nbsp;it. We&nbsp;talked again.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/33f/319/b199a95c45bed757b2b9a3db38.jpg><p>What would happen <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>next</a>, however, was even more extraordinary. “The night after, I&nbsp;attended a&nbsp;play. I&nbsp;arrived late, snuck&nbsp;in, and sat down,” Pauletta explained. “I&nbsp;didn’t look who was around&nbsp;me. Then, at&nbsp;intermission, the lights came on&nbsp;and we&nbsp;were sitting next to&nbsp;each other.”</p><p>Denzel also has his anecdotes about this, which they often joke about when they recall the time. He&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a> that on&nbsp;their first date, Pauletta had to&nbsp;pay for the cab because he&nbsp;didn’t have enough money to&nbsp;cover the entire fair.</p><p>You’d think that anybody would say “yes” if&nbsp;a&nbsp;guy like Denzel Washington asked to&nbsp;marry them, but that’s what proves how Pauletta Washington is&nbsp;different. The same goes for the acclaimed actor, as&nbsp;not just any man would continue to&nbsp;insist after a&nbsp;negative response to&nbsp;a&nbsp;<a href=# title=marriage data-link=tag>marriage</a> proposal.</p><p>The couple often jokes about&nbsp;it. Pauletta <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;turned you down twice, and the third time we&nbsp;did&nbsp;it.” However, the 2&nbsp;succeeded in&nbsp;proving to&nbsp;each other that their relationship would be&nbsp;worthwhile by&nbsp;confirming their bond on&nbsp;the third <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>attempt</a> on&nbsp;June&nbsp;25, 1983.</p><p>Denzel did not have a&nbsp;rosy <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a> background. He&nbsp;said that while his parents instilled good values in&nbsp;him, they <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>divorced</a> when he&nbsp;was 14. When he&nbsp;met Pauletta, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>realized</a> he&nbsp;loved her: “Her family had a&nbsp;love and closeness that&nbsp;I didn’t have. I&nbsp;came from a&nbsp;broken home, and&nbsp;I said&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;have that.”</p><p>Hollywood is&nbsp;not usually a&nbsp;fitting place for successful couples. Media pressure, followers, and hectic social lives, among other aspects, can pose great challenges to&nbsp;a&nbsp;stable relationship. However, this couple has been able to&nbsp;successfully overcome these challenges. In&nbsp;this regard, Pauletta has shown admirable faith and confidence, as&nbsp;she “does not <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>allow</a> other women or&nbsp;rumors to&nbsp;distract her from her marriage.”</p><p>The <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Malcolm X</i></a>&nbsp;star never misses an&nbsp;opportunity to&nbsp;acknowledge his wife and say that it’s thanks to&nbsp;her support that he&nbsp;has achieved his success. In&nbsp;2019, at&nbsp;the 47th AFI Life Achievement Awards, a&nbsp;celebration in&nbsp;which he&nbsp;was honored, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>mentioned</a> his wife in&nbsp;his “Thank You” speech: “40&nbsp;years of&nbsp;sacrifice.&nbsp;40&nbsp;years of&nbsp;forgiveness. She taught me&nbsp;about faith, spirituality, love, real love, unwavering love, in&nbsp;spite of&nbsp;myself.”</p><p>Pauletta is&nbsp;a&nbsp;classically trained pianist. She has been an&nbsp;outstanding actress in&nbsp;theater and film and participated in&nbsp;acclaimed productions, such as&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#><i>Philadelphia</i></a> (1993), which won numerous awards. When Denzel speaks of&nbsp;sacrifice, he&nbsp;does so&nbsp;because Pauletta put aside her professional career to&nbsp;devote herself to&nbsp;her home. Despite this, now that her children are older, she has returned to&nbsp;acting.</p><p>This same respect and, undoubtedly, all the principles and values that characterize the couple are reflected in&nbsp;their children. About her, John David <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “I&nbsp;love my&nbsp;mother. The fact that she sacrificed so&nbsp;much to&nbsp;raise 4&nbsp;children, and as&nbsp;she has gotten back into acting, I&nbsp;am so&nbsp;proud. Everything she does...pushes me&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;the best.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7d6/1d8/9fefd75206a08bb8e4f0483f94.jpg><p>The couple maintains a&nbsp;lively sense of&nbsp;humor. When Denzel was asked what the secret to&nbsp;a&nbsp;lasting marriage was, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>replied</a>, “I&nbsp;do as&nbsp;I’m told. I&nbsp;keep my&nbsp;mouth shut.” However, with a&nbsp;little more seriousness, he&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>said</a>, “There is&nbsp;no&nbsp;secret to&nbsp;the perfect marriage. Everybody has their ups and downs; we’ve had ours. It’s hard work, you know. But we&nbsp;made a&nbsp;commitment. A&nbsp;spiritual foundation helps everything: marriage, work, peace of&nbsp;mind.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/64c/a69/86c5e55394b5e711a478b3ee16.jpg><p>These days, Denzel Washington has good reason to&nbsp;celebrate, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;has been nominated for the 2022&nbsp;Oscars, completing 10&nbsp;nominations throughout his career. This, in&nbsp;itself, is&nbsp;already a&nbsp;triumph, as&nbsp;he&nbsp;has gone down in&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>history</a> as&nbsp;the African-American artist who has been <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>nominated</a> for Best Actor the most times. Although, for him, his greatest <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>success</a> has been with his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/dae/fea/17e6765ee3a45755e530fc9573.jpg><p>What love story do&nbsp;you know of&nbsp;where someone in&nbsp;the couple had to&nbsp;insist that the 2&nbsp;of&nbsp;them being together was the best decision?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLqivtGinJ1llqS%2Fbq3LpqasrF1pfW7FxJqprGWRm8GmvoybnKKml2K%2FprbEnKuenF2pxKqvxGaZsmWYnsBuw8ifnGaclaPHpriMsJisoJmjtLW7zaxkrKyfp8Zuv8eorqxlp52utXnTq6yeZaCav7Sx1Z6pmqaTmnp5fJVrbG1n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
