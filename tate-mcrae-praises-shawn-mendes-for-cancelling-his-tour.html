The singer hasn’t shared her upcoming plans at this time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Shawn Mendes Cancels His Tour</h2><p>On July 27, The Voice mega mentor Shawn Mendes opened up about his mental health struggles while announcing the cancellation of his tour. The singer explained that touring took a toll on him, noting he wasn’t fully prepared to go back on the road.</p><p>“After speaking more with my team and working with an incredible group of health professionals, it has become clear that I need to take the time I’ve never taken personally, to ground myself and come back stronger,” he wrote. “I unfortunately have to cancel the rest of the tour dates in North America, and the UK/Europe.”</p><p>Even though Mendes was excited to perform again, it seems like the timing isn’t right at this moment. At the end of the announcement, the singer clarified that this isn’t the end of his music career. Instead, he’s treating his health as his first priority at this time.</p><p>“This doesn’t mean I won’t be making new music, and I can’t wait to see you on tour in the future,” he wrote. “I know you all have been waiting so long to see these shows, and it breaks my heart to tell you this but I promise I will be back as soon as I’ve taken the right time to heal.”</p><p>Fans have poured their support out to the singer since his cancellation announcement. Other celebrities like <a href=#>Demi Lovato</a> have recently stepped forward to praise Mendes’s decision.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Original_SYTYCDJudges_Ray-Mickshaw_FOX.jpg alt="‘So You Think You Can Dance’ Top 3 Announced for Season 17" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>shawn mendes</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5705qrnmWdmL%2BisYypqZqho5rAbr%2FHmq6nZZ2au6Wx0madqKpdmK6vr8Slo6Kml2K1qr%2BMraauql8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
