He has since assumed authority as part of the triad of the reign of father, wife and son.</p><p>“The appointment as DG of PPMIU for Babajide, a young man who carries on as though he was the person voted for as Governor, is part of the grand design to finally empty the treasury of the State before Akeredolu returns to Ibadan.”</p><p>The party also said governor Akeredolu and his immediate family are bent on living fat on the lean resources of the people of Ondo state.</p><p>“There is no further proof of Akeredolu’s insensitivity to the plight of the people, when within two years of tenure, he organized three lavish weddings for his children, all in foreign lands—In Mauritius, Canada, and Colorado, USA”, the party said.</p><p>The party urged the Akeredolus to beware that they’ll account for the “resources they are wasting in this reckless manner" on the day of reckoning.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdku6bD0minqKSZqbakv46pm6llpJawrLjErGSgp6Zirqyx0Z6bqKSlYrOwvoyap6mnmaPBqrrGZp%2Biq12ovK95wKxknaGimrC1u9Fmnp6mlaeurXnOn2Sapl2WtKa6wrJmnmmWnYKstg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
