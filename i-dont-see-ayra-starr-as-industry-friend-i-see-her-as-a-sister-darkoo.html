I feel like I was able to find that in Ayra Starr, I don't even see her as an industry friend; I see her as my sister," she said.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>Darkoo stressed that their solid friendship stems from their similarities and mutual respect; she also noted that they learn from each other.</p><p>She explained, "I feel like why we merge so well is because we're very alike but what I really love her is that she's so respectful. You can just tell that she is a proper Naija girl, by the way she looks at life. She also teaches me a lot of stuff; we teach each other stuff and I love that type of relationship."</p><p>Darkoo also stressed that while she is friendly with many people in the industry, she differentiates these casual interactions from deeper friendships.</p><p>"In terms of going out and seeing people, I won't say that they're my 'friends' and we talk all the time. I'm a very friendly person, so it's easy to make those friendships but it doesn't go further than just seeing each other and DMing each other. I feel like the distance is fine because see finish is a real thing, when you get too close and too comfortable with people they start to disrespect you," she added.</p><p>See the full interview below:</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdksq%2FAxKurmqGeorKvwI6cnKWdkqe2tbXErGaiZZSku7V50p6cZpmpp65uv9Oaqatlkah6qrrDrqqtqqlis7O1xKebZqFdqLKmeceeqWaZo2Kubr%2FIrKueql2ZrrO3zqhmsXBhZrilvw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
