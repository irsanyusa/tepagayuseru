Even the metallic face shield she was wearing was no match for the detectives online. The controversial YouTuber carried a yellow Fendi bag, the same one she posed with in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>a recent Instagram post</a>. She is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly partnered with Val Chmerkovskiy.</a></p><p>NBA free agent Iman Shumpert was also wearing the same kind of face shield <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving the set this week</a>. The man is super tall. How did the producers think nobody would recognize him? <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Several sources</a> say he will be hitting the dance floor with Daniella Karagach.</p><p>Amanda Kloots was seen on set wearing a face shield and a workout outfit that she first showed off in an Instagram story. The Talk host is believed to be partnered with Alan Bersten. Kloots posted an Instagram video in May dancing through the New York City streets with a caption about missing dancing.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CPRKXH_n9Dy/</p></figure><p>Someone with a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">distinct arm tattoo</a> was spotted on set this week. The Dancing with the Stars detectives on Twitter cracked the case that it was Jimmie Allen. The country singer and American Idol alum will supposedly be dancing with Emma Slater. Several <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE outlets</a> have also reported that Mike “The Miz” Mizanin is also on Season 30. He recently missed a wrestling match, allegedly due to the Dancing with the Stars schedule.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-other-confirmed-contestants>Other Confirmed Contestants</h2><p>Brian Austin Green has been on Dancing with the Stars fans’ radars for an entire year. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TMZ</a> already caught wind that he is finally dancing on Season 30. It is not confirmed yet if he will be dancing with girlfriend <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sharna Burgess</a>. The outlet also reported that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kenya Moore</a>&nbsp;will be competing too. The Real Housewives of Atlanta star is partnered with Brandon Armstrong.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">JoJo Siwa</a> and Sunisa Lee have been able to walk freely around the set without face shields because they were supposed to be the only two contestants officially announced before the cast reveal. Siwa is reportedly partnered with Jenna Johnson and Lee will be dancing with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Sasha Farber</a>. A source told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">US Weekly</a> that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Bachelor</a> star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt James</a> is also headed to the ballroom.</p><p>If you are keeping track, that is 10 out of the 15 contestants spoiled before the official GMA announcement. At this point, all of the contestants should just be able to walk in and out of the studio freely. The secrecy element really isn’t there this season. The historic Season 30 should have started with a cooler cast surprise.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CTDOZP1rkp0/</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dancing-with-the-stars-needs-to-heighten-secrecy-on-set-like-the-masked-singer>‘Dancing With the Stars’ Needs to Heighten Secrecy on Set Like ‘The Masked Singer’</h2><p>Dancing with the Stars contestants need to wear better disguises on set just like they do on The Masked Singer. Even members of each celebrities entourage wear disguises on The Masked Singer. The celebrities aren’t even referred to by their real names on set. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joey Fatone</a> walked around set wearing a purple graduation gown and a ridiculous mask to conceal his identity in Season 1.</p><p>The contestants don’t even know who they are competing against on the show. Everyone involved <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">signs strict contracts</a>, including the audience members. Only about 25 members of the production team know the identities of the masked celebrities. Dancing with the Stars can take inspiration from the successful Fox show.</p><p>Granted, there have been only a handful of slip-ups that have spoiled some reveals on The Masked Singer. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Caitlyn Jenner</a> told her children she would be competing on the show before being spotted in a “Don’t Talk To Me”&nbsp;hoodie. These hoodies are a telltale sign that a celebrity is competing on the show.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tyrese Gibson</a> posted a video wearing the hoodie before his Season 5 reveal. Mackenzie Ziegler’s mom was spotted wearing the hoodie out and so was Maksim Chmerkovskiy’s wife, Peta Murgatroyd. Other contestants announced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">big musical releases</a> and new projects before their reveals. This spoils the show in ways that are out of the hands of The Masked Singer production team.</p><p>Some strategies that The Masked Singer uses definitely do work. After an entire year of waiting for Season 30 of Dancing with the Stars, we were hoping that the cast reveal would be worth the wait. Instead, the excitement of a full cast reveal has been taken away.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/corbin-e1630942618458.jpeg alt="10 Celebrities You Forgot Were On ‘Dancing With The Stars’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>dancing with the stars</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>DWTS</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK571qKroWWjpHqurc2yZJ2Znpi2r7OMsKCtoF2ptaZ50q2Yq6tdqL2wtcueqaxlp52utb%2BMrZ%2BeZaCktq%2FAjKidZpldmK60wIyrnK%2BdkaF8</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
