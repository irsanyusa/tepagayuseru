This touching message by the groom's mum</p><p>"Over six years ago, Tony introduced Whitney to the family and since she came along, everything fell into place as his life became more organized. Whitney’s family welcomed him as one of their own.</p><p>“But, then, we worried about the cultural divide. However, Whitney quickly learned to adjust to the many traditional differences with aplomb and gracefulness. Then Whitney introduced her mother—sweet and gentle as a breeze—and our family knew the deal was sealed. The apple does not fall far from the tree.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“Whitney, you are a charming, sophisticated and graceful lady full of warmth. You are our daughter now and a part of the family. We love you.</p><p>“Tony, I can close my eyes and still see you seating on the floor in Washington, D.C. playing with your “chu-chu” train. I can still see you flying down the rail bannister with your Batman costume. But now your flying days are over as we await another Batman to take your place in the family.</p><p>“Since this time, you have become a fine young man and I am so proud of you and extremely happy to be your mother. You have shouldered your responsibility of elder sibling with tenacity, compassion and humility. As you mature into a loving brother, son and soon father, the girl you picked is exactly right and perfect for you.</p><p>“Let us admit, marriage is a rollercoaster ride; there will be blissful moments and turbulent times. But that Tony is taking this journey with Whitney puts our mind at ease. She is such a beautiful soul.</p><p>“And as two become one on April 14, remember that our whole family is behind Whitney and that we will be there for you Tony as you begin this journey… “A man shall leave his father and mother and be united to his wife…”</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><p>“May God Bless your marriage. Welcome to our family Whitney!!!”</p><p>5.
