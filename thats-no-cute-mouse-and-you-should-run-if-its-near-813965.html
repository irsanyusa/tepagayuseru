You open your eyes and see...oh, hi, Biscuit. Your pet hamster that you took in&nbsp;just yesterday is&nbsp;sitting right before you. And there’s something... <i>primal</i> about&nbsp;it.</p><p>Suddenly, the hamster stands up&nbsp;on&nbsp;its hind legs and howls like a&nbsp;wolf! Only much higher, like a&nbsp;whistle. Then, Biscuit scampers to&nbsp;the window, takes one last look at&nbsp;you and jumps out into the street. What in&nbsp;the world was that!?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/da9/983/5de79452ceacae7dc1b80d7dc2.png><p>Calm down... It’s just that what you took for a&nbsp;hamster was really a&nbsp;<strong>werewolf mouse</strong>. Or&nbsp;simply, <strong>grasshopper mouse</strong>. It’s a&nbsp;perfect hunter: it’s agile, quick, and doesn’t feel pain. The mouse lives in&nbsp;North America and doesn’t like digging holes. Why work if&nbsp;you can drive the owners out of&nbsp;their homes? This cute ball of&nbsp;fuzz preys on&nbsp;grasshoppers, snakes, and spiders, but most of&nbsp;all it&nbsp;loves dangerous prey.</p><p><strong>Arizona bark</strong> <strong>scorpions</strong> are extremely venomous, but our cutie here&nbsp;— he&nbsp;doesn’t care. Over millions of&nbsp;years of&nbsp;evolution, the rodent learned to&nbsp;process scorpion neurotoxins into an&nbsp;energy drink. The <a href=# title=venom data-link=tag>venom</a> is&nbsp;for this mouse like 100 cups of&nbsp;coffee for you, plus it&nbsp;helps you not feel pain! The more venom in&nbsp;the mouse’s body, the more it&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;Viking went berserk. After the battle, the rodent raises its head into the night sky and howls. The sound is&nbsp;more like a&nbsp;whistle, but loud. If&nbsp;the animal howled in&nbsp;the center of&nbsp;a&nbsp;soccer field, you’d hear it&nbsp;from the stands.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/2d2/82f/877ff7516897d33eceef94d7ce.png><p>This way, the mouse makes itself known and tells everyone, “I’m in&nbsp;charge here, so&nbsp;don’t you dare cross&nbsp;me!” You don’t believe&nbsp;it? Ask the poor scorpion. So&nbsp;when you woke up&nbsp;in&nbsp;your room, your mouse was singing a&nbsp;victory song. It&nbsp;may have just chased away a&nbsp;poisonous insect that had infiltrated your room. Nature took pity on&nbsp;humanity and made the grasshopper mouse small. But if&nbsp;you see one close&nbsp;by, then get out of&nbsp;there quickly. It&nbsp;means the werewolf mouse is&nbsp;hunting and there’s a&nbsp;scorpion somewhere near.</p><p>Mouse cubs, even in&nbsp;captivity, remain aggressive. They’re like the Spartan children of&nbsp;antiquity. From the first days of&nbsp;life, they’re ready to&nbsp;fight. Imagine that you got a&nbsp;job in&nbsp;a&nbsp;company creating our planet. You come to&nbsp;the office, and your boss says, “Newbie, I&nbsp;need a&nbsp;project on&nbsp;a&nbsp;new animal on&nbsp;my&nbsp;desk, tonight!” Besides yourself, you tried a&nbsp;bit too hard, and the result was the <strong>platypus</strong>...</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/077/7bc/426d715207be6b55ce4a735aec.png><p>The animal is&nbsp;covered with soft fur, it’s got a&nbsp;tail like a&nbsp;beaver’s, flippers, and a&nbsp;duck’s bill. The platypus lays eggs but feeds its young with milk. You’ve got a&nbsp;crazy imagination! Male platypuses have venomous spurs on&nbsp;their hind legs. The venom isn’t dangerous to&nbsp;humans, but you still better avoid petting the animal. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;stings you with those spurs, then a&nbsp;week of&nbsp;severe pain is&nbsp;guaranteed.</p><p>What animal has the nastiest temperament on&nbsp;the planet? That’s easy: a&nbsp;<strong>honey badger</strong>. Most of&nbsp;all, it&nbsp;resembles a&nbsp;skunk that visits the wrestling gym 5&nbsp;times a&nbsp;week. And it&nbsp;smells like that too. The honey badger weighs as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;a&nbsp;two-year-old child, but it’s not afraid of&nbsp;anyone. It&nbsp;doesn’t care who’s confronting&nbsp;it, be&nbsp;it&nbsp;a&nbsp;venomous snake, two lions, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;pack of&nbsp;hyenas. It’ll attack them&nbsp;— and win. You want honey? No&nbsp;problem. Befriend a&nbsp;badger, and it’ll demolish a&nbsp;bee hive for you.</p><p>It’s not afraid of&nbsp;stings. The honey badger has a&nbsp;thick skin that’s difficult to&nbsp;break through. And also sharp claws and strong jaws. The honey badger scares everyone in&nbsp;Africa, but it’s got cousins in&nbsp;North America and Eurasia. Those guys have a&nbsp;bad temper too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/34b/c68/69e5195d3cb9f95503d4e75218.png><p>Although it’s difficult to&nbsp;call it&nbsp;a&nbsp;giant, <strong>wolverine</strong> will not hesitate to&nbsp;attack a&nbsp;bear or&nbsp;an&nbsp;elk. The animal grows no&nbsp;larger than a&nbsp;medium-sized dog. If&nbsp;you offended&nbsp;it... then&nbsp;I don’t envy you. It’s hardy, knows how to&nbsp;swim, and is&nbsp;a&nbsp;fast runner. Wide paws are like snowshoes and don’t allow it&nbsp;to&nbsp;fall into the snow. You can’t hide from a&nbsp;wolverine on&nbsp;a&nbsp;tree either&nbsp;— it&nbsp;climbs with uncanny agility.</p><p>The <strong>wombat</strong> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;cute animal that resembles a&nbsp;fluffy bear. It’s stocky and weighs as&nbsp;much as&nbsp;a&nbsp;German Shepherd. The wombat lives in&nbsp;Australia, where it&nbsp;digs deep holes and has the most original protection in&nbsp;the world. If&nbsp;the enemy tries to&nbsp;get into its underground house, the wombat blocks the entrance with its, um, backside. This part of&nbsp;the body consists of&nbsp;four fused bones. For a&nbsp;wombat, it’s a&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;shield, and it’s difficult for a&nbsp;predator to&nbsp;bite through&nbsp;it. The animal is&nbsp;peaceful, but it&nbsp;has poor eyesight and, well, isn’t very smart. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;thinks you’re posing a&nbsp;threat, it&nbsp;will attack.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/196/3fb/25abe8532483a91071a5de73cb.png><p>The <strong>Indian gray mongoose</strong> is&nbsp;a&nbsp;real champion when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;fighting cobras. During the fight, it’s beautiful, and dances so&nbsp;fast that the snake doesn’t have time to&nbsp;react to&nbsp;tricks. Cobra gets tired and decides to&nbsp;run away as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible. The animal is&nbsp;protected from cobra fangs by&nbsp;its thick fur and immunity to&nbsp;cobra venom. Mongooses are relatives of&nbsp;cats and are popular pets in&nbsp;India. The animals love to&nbsp;sit on&nbsp;their owner’s lap but retain a&nbsp;wild character. In&nbsp;nature, mongooses rarely attack people, but if&nbsp;cornered, they become unpredictable.</p><p>Nobody knows how many <strong>rats</strong> there are on&nbsp;the planet exactly, but at&nbsp;least twice as&nbsp;many as&nbsp;us humans.<strong> </strong>These are amazing animals that can laugh, dream, and feel stress.<strong> </strong>They live in&nbsp;packs and can hunt prey dozens of&nbsp;times larger than themselves. Scientists have found rat bite marks on&nbsp;the ribs of&nbsp;dinosaurs that are <strong>75&nbsp;million years old</strong>. They also have kings. They don’t wear crowns, though. It’s the name for several rats whose tails are tied in&nbsp;a&nbsp;knot. The largest king ever recorded consisted of&nbsp;32&nbsp;animals.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/236/e9c/3c4dd757178ec08aed6fb40057.png><p><strong>Possums</strong> have been around since the days of&nbsp;the dinosaurs. Their acting skills helped them survive to&nbsp;this day. As&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;danger appears nearby, this hero rarely rushes into the fray, but it&nbsp;doesn’t run away either. It&nbsp;falls to&nbsp;the ground and starts, well, playing possum. It&nbsp;doesn’t move at&nbsp;all and even slows down its breath and heartbeat. I’m sure this animal deserves an&nbsp;Oscar. For realism, the actor releases a&nbsp;scent. It’s so&nbsp;bad that predators would rather stay hungry than approach a&nbsp;possum.</p><p>The animal has no&nbsp;control over its acting ability. It’s a&nbsp;natural response to&nbsp;stress. Possums aren’t aggressive, but if&nbsp;cornered, they growl, their fur stands on&nbsp;end, and they show their teeth&nbsp;— small but razor-sharp. You won’t call <strong>solenodon</strong> a&nbsp;nice guy. You can recognize it&nbsp;by&nbsp;red hair, a&nbsp;Pinocchio nose, and a&nbsp;hairless long tail. It’s got sharp teeth and special glands in&nbsp;its mouth that make the saliva toxic. Surprisingly, the animal has no&nbsp;immunity against its own venom. That’s why it’s really careful while grooming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/27f/f61/7f8b2f5b258cfcbf92acf7d7d0.png><p>Solenodons are aggressive by&nbsp;nature. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;gets bored, it&nbsp;gets angry, grunts like a&nbsp;pig, and can lunge at&nbsp;anyone in&nbsp;the vicinity. Luckily, its toxic saliva isn’t harmful to&nbsp;humans. <strong>Pygmy jerboa</strong> is&nbsp;the smallest rodent on&nbsp;Earth. It&nbsp;looks like a&nbsp;baby kangaroo and weighs a&nbsp;little more than a&nbsp;penny. The largest is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>capybara</strong>, and it’s difficult to&nbsp;look at&nbsp;it&nbsp;without a&nbsp;smile. But this isn’t the limit! Millions of&nbsp;years ago, a&nbsp;rodent the size of&nbsp;an&nbsp;African buffalo lived on&nbsp;the planet. <strong>Phoberomys</strong> ate plants and resembled both a&nbsp;hippo and an&nbsp;overgrown guinea pig at&nbsp;the same time.</p><p>Now, the next animal would easily win the first prize for the <strong>Most Unusual Rodent on&nbsp;the Planet</strong>. This monster is&nbsp;a&nbsp;<strong>naked mole-rat</strong>. And yes, it’s naked and lives underground. Its appearance is&nbsp;too much even for a&nbsp;rodent. Most of&nbsp;all, the mole-rat looks like a&nbsp;sausage from a&nbsp;horror movie. But that’s not the point. On&nbsp;average, a&nbsp;rodent of&nbsp;this size lives for <strong>2-3&nbsp;years</strong>. A&nbsp;naked mole-rat lives in&nbsp;the wild for <strong>30&nbsp;years</strong>. Imagine if&nbsp;people could live to&nbsp;be&nbsp;1,000 years old. For a&nbsp;rodent, 30&nbsp;is much the same. Scientists believe that perhaps this unsightly digger will help humanity solve the problem of&nbsp;aging.</p><p>One family can have up&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>300</strong> naked mole-rats. In&nbsp;the concrete-hard African soil, they dig cities the size of&nbsp;6&nbsp;football fields. People don’t meet these rats. They rarely come to&nbsp;the surface and drink no&nbsp;water. These rodents get moisture from plant roots.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGprdOsZKenXZjCtbGMpqauq5Virq%2BwjLKmrmWjnby2uMNmqa6mXZ6zbrXTrGSnnZGnenl9knJtbmc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
