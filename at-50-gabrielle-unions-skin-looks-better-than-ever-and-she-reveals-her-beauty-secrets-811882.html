Afraid of&nbsp;needles, Union never turned to&nbsp;<a href=# title="plastic surgery" data-link=tag>plastic surgery</a> or&nbsp;<a href=# title=Botox data-link=tag>Botox</a>. Instead, she focuses on&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;herself both physically and mentally. Over the years, she’s found a&nbsp;routine that works wonders for her, and she decided to&nbsp;share some foolproof tips.</p><p><h2>She’s too scared of&nbsp;needles to&nbsp;try plastic surgery or&nbsp;Botox.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/3b5/89f/c8fbd45e11b7d24a35f34a4e64.jpg><p>Like many other <a href=#>celebs</a>, Gabrielle Union isn’t an&nbsp;advocate of&nbsp;<a href=#>plastic surgery</a>." I&nbsp;have flaws, but&nbsp;I would never consider plastic surgery," the actress revealed in&nbsp;an&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>interview</a> more than a&nbsp;decade ago. And several years later, she still hasn’t changed her mind. But her fear of&nbsp;needles is&nbsp;really preventing her from going under the knife or&nbsp;trying Botox. “I&nbsp;don’t like <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>needles</a>. I’m not going to&nbsp;rule out Botox, but the idea of&nbsp;putting a&nbsp;needle in&nbsp;my&nbsp;face&nbsp;— I’m not there yet.”</p><p><h2>She doesn’t follow a&nbsp;strict diet.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/131/f58/1593365e4681703131c5685a85.jpg><p>Union prioritizes a&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>healthy diet</a>, but she doesn’t like to&nbsp;restrict herself too much when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;food that she enjoys. She likes to&nbsp;indulge from time to&nbsp;time, eating her favorites like French fries, chicken wings, or&nbsp;cookies. But when she’s busy with shootings, she turns to&nbsp;healthier alternatives. One such favorite is&nbsp;a&nbsp;juice made of&nbsp;beets, carrots, and kale, which she drinks almost daily.</p><p><h2>She gets regular exercise in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;stay healthy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/034/008/58870952fa8cf5ea3fa6004f59.jpg><p>The famous actress revealed a&nbsp;history of&nbsp;illness in&nbsp;her family, like diabetes, high blood pressure, and cholesterol. To&nbsp;decrease her likelihood of&nbsp;developing these illnesses, Union has a&nbsp;regular workout routine. “I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;a&nbsp;vital and energetic part of&nbsp;my&nbsp;family for a&nbsp;long time. I&nbsp;work out not because&nbsp;I get off on&nbsp;it&nbsp;but because&nbsp;I want to&nbsp;live!” she <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>confessed</a>.</p><p>Even though she only works out for around 20&nbsp;minutes daily, she mixes various exercises into her routine. She likes Pilates, cardio (like interval training), and strength training, which helps her feel more <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>energized</a>.</p><p><h2>She has always struggled with oily skin, but this has now become an&nbsp;advantage.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/839/eaf/e4bef75e94b8bec3089e6d760c.jpg><p>“I’ve had <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>oily skin</a> my&nbsp;whole life,” Gabrielle Union explained. “When you’re a&nbsp;teenager, and it’s wreaking havoc on&nbsp;your skin, it&nbsp;feels like the worst thing in&nbsp;the world. But as&nbsp;you get older, that oil is&nbsp;sort of&nbsp;like embalming fluid, if&nbsp;you will. It&nbsp;keeps you youthful-looking.” According to&nbsp;scientists, people with oily rather than dry skin develop <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wrinkles</a> later in&nbsp;life. On&nbsp;the other hand, it’s a&nbsp;<a href=#>myth</a> that people with oily skin shouldn’t use a&nbsp;moisturizer, as&nbsp;they still need hydration.</p><p><h2>When it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;skincare, she sticks to&nbsp;the essentials.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b0a/451/fe95995f5b98934452cbb16adf.jpg><p>Although relatively simple, Union has a&nbsp;foolproof <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>routine</a> that keeps her skin youthful and glowing. In&nbsp;the morning, she starts with a&nbsp;cream-based cleanser or&nbsp;an&nbsp;oil-free acne wash, moving on&nbsp;to&nbsp;scrub, then a&nbsp;toner and facial oil. She finishes with sunscreen that she makes sure to&nbsp;use every single day.</p><p>In&nbsp;the evening, she stresses the importance of&nbsp;always removing your makeup before bed. Again, this step is&nbsp;followed by&nbsp;a&nbsp;cleanser and a&nbsp;toner. She also likes to&nbsp;use specific serums in&nbsp;the evening, like retinol and a&nbsp;color-correcting serum. Despite having oily skin, Gabrielle Union knows well that she still needs to&nbsp;use a&nbsp;moisturizer and an&nbsp;eye cream, which are a&nbsp;part of&nbsp;her routine, while she uses a&nbsp;sleeping mask occasionally for extra hydration.</p><p><h2>“My&nbsp;best anti-aging tip is&nbsp;the ability to&nbsp;say&nbsp;no.”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4d8/3e0/27e7b85e52b8e778db07b7b70e.jpg><p>Besides caring for her physical health, the most crucial thing for looking and feeling youthful is&nbsp;eliminating <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>stress</a>. “My&nbsp;best anti-aging tip is&nbsp;the ability to&nbsp;say&nbsp;no, no, and hell&nbsp;no,” she said. “We&nbsp;run ourselves ragged saying yes to&nbsp;every freaking thing, whether it’s to&nbsp;our family, spouses, or&nbsp;careers. I&nbsp;sleep 8&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;day and don’t let myself stress out. A&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;people call it&nbsp;selfish, but&nbsp;I don’t have any wrinkles,” the gorgeous actress jokingly explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9fc/e3b/95ddb950419442ee8940df411e.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZK61eZRpZKCZkqe2prjLnmSuppmku7R50qSgp2WcpLysv4ybnK2slad6tbTAp2SerpWneqK6w2aqoZ1dp7K3scClqmaglad6o7HArquyZaOasLOx06xkcWlhbYVzew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
