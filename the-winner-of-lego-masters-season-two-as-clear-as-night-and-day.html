Teams pulled out all the stops as they faced their biggest challenge yet. <a href=#>12 teams began</a> and just three pairs of brothers competed for the title and Mark and Steven’s hard work all season awarded them victory.</strong></p><p>Of course, a finale has to be the biggest event of the season and LEGO Masters did not break tradition. More guest stars, more surprises, and the season’s biggest challenge made the perfect recipe for a finale.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-building-day-and-night-for-the-epic-lego-masters-finale>Building Day and Night for the Epic LEGO Masters Finale</h2><p>One challenge away from the title and the $100,000, the three teams of brothers had just one giant obstacle to clear. For their final challenge, they were given 24 hours to build any <a href=#>MOC</a> they wanted. The twist here was the build would have to present one look with the lights on and another when the lights go off.</p><p>During the 24 hour build-a-thon, some familiar faces dropped by to check in on the epic finale. Bill Puppét returned from <a href=#>the LEGO Puppet Theater</a>. He upped the ante for the already tense competition by announcing the winning build would be displayed at <a href=#>LEGOLAND Florida</a>. The opportunity to have LEGO display your work is an honor as esteemed as the title of LEGO Master.</p><p>As the clock continued to wind down, host Will Arnett was joined <a href=#>once again by The Masked Singer judge</a> and FOX’s biggest personality Ken Jeong. He brought with him encouraging messages from home for each of the remaining teams. Having been in the show’s production bubble, the messages from their families and loved ones were deeply emotional. It also was the encouragement they needed to stay focused in the home stretch.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" readability=2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CTz0TOPtaon/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link</p></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lego-masters-crowns-season-2-winners>LEGO Masters Crowns Season 2 Winners</h3><p>With these teams pulling out their best tricks, the final judging was not going to be easy for Amy and Jamie. After 24 hours and a close inspection of each final build’s day and night features, the long-anticipated second season was ready to name its second champions.</p><p>The brick masters decided that it was the brother duo of Mark and Steven that were this season’s LEGO Masters and best of the brothers. Their giant tree spirit and landscape were the right amount of imagination the brick masters look for. Their night look even used light to bring a motion to water. That’s certifiable LEGO Master ingenuity.</p><p>Zack and Wayne finished second. The team with the most technical skill always blew judges away, but their laco of imaginative storytelling was their Achilles’ heel. The pagoda they built was the largest of the builds but it all felt repeated.</p><p>With Mark and Steven officially named LEGO Masters season two winners, they prove once again they’re <a href=#>as good as season one winners Tyler and Amy</a>. Could there be a future face-off brewing?</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/MS-S6_EP601-Show-GG_00433.jpg alt="‘The Masked Singer’ Season 6 Reveals New Clues, Hints at Big Twist" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK5706GcZq%2BZo7umvoyonWaklZy8brnArKueqqNiwKat0qilZqynpHqiv4yco56ZomKutHnNop6hrF2Wu6V5w5qwaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
