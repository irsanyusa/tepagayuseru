She’d told me&nbsp;that she’d given up&nbsp;a&nbsp;child for adoption when she was young, so&nbsp;I was expecting that this might happen.</p><p>What I&nbsp;didn’t expect was that the truth was there was never any adoption. She just left the baby with the father and bailed.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f96/03f/792a9e54eba2051a878803e697.jpg><p>“The worst thing about this is&nbsp;that when Laurel was&nbsp;12, she wrote my&nbsp;wife begging for help. Her response was to&nbsp;write her the nastiest reply imaginable (I’ve since had a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;read&nbsp;it) that basically blamed her for her problems and threatened her against contacting her again and ’ruining her family’.</p><p>I&nbsp;couldn’t believe&nbsp;it. Not only she has been lying this whole time, but she actively had contact and chose to&nbsp;abandon her a&nbsp;second time while we&nbsp;were married. This has all been an&nbsp;emotional dumpster fire, but that’s an&nbsp;issue of&nbsp;its own.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/290/ab7/91612c5e4392fc2fdd6a045313.jpg><p>“We’ve been in&nbsp;contact and building a&nbsp;<a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> for the last few years. So&nbsp;much therapy. So&nbsp;far, we’ve kept this all away from our kids. At&nbsp;this point, it’s been a&nbsp;few years, and there’s interest in&nbsp;having everyone meet.</p><p>The thing&nbsp;is, between my&nbsp;wife and Laurel, they’ve come to&nbsp;an ’agreement’ to&nbsp;tell the kids and everyone else in&nbsp;the family that Laurel is&nbsp;a&nbsp;family friend. Absolutely not. I’m sick of&nbsp;the lying. What they call each other is&nbsp;their own deal and&nbsp;I don’t expect that to&nbsp;change, but I’m not lying anymore. I&nbsp;don’t like lying to&nbsp;my&nbsp;kids as&nbsp;a&nbsp;policy, but lying to&nbsp;them about who’s related to&nbsp;them and who isn’t is&nbsp;dangerous.</p><p>I&nbsp;only want them to&nbsp;meet if&nbsp;we&nbsp;can tell them the truth. Now I’m getting into it&nbsp;with my&nbsp;wife, Laurel, and my&nbsp;parents (the only outside people who know). They say&nbsp;I should go&nbsp;along with&nbsp;it, not for my&nbsp;wife’s sake but for Laurel’s. I&nbsp;understand why she would want that, but&nbsp;I don’t think&nbsp;I care anymore.

And you’ll be&nbsp;just as&nbsp;guilty as&nbsp;her in&nbsp;your kids’ eyes for lying by&nbsp;omission. If&nbsp;she’s that ashamed, then she shouldn’t be&nbsp;bringing Laurel around the family.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>RichSignal7022&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>“So&nbsp;your wife wants to&nbsp;continue this lie forever. Your kids are going to&nbsp;find out eventually. It’s going to&nbsp;happen no&nbsp;matter how hard your wife protects her lie. Just doing a&nbsp;DNA test from Ancestry will uncover&nbsp;it. A&nbsp;relative who knows can slip&nbsp;up. Does she want the kids to&nbsp;find out like that? They might hate her forever for&nbsp;it.<br>This lie is&nbsp;going to&nbsp;cause an&nbsp;avalanche of&nbsp;issues, and your children deserve to&nbsp;know this person is&nbsp;their sister. Their sister also deserves to&nbsp;know her siblings as&nbsp;siblings, not as&nbsp;generic friends. Hasn’t your wife damaged her enough with the abandonment? I&nbsp;can’t imagine being the daughter who was treated this way.<br>As&nbsp;for you, I&nbsp;don’t think&nbsp;I could stay with a&nbsp;person capable of&nbsp;this. She’s been lying to&nbsp;you, and that’s not forgivable to&nbsp;me. There is&nbsp;nothing to&nbsp;stop you from being honest with your own children. You don’t have to&nbsp;keep the secret.<br>What is&nbsp;your wife going to&nbsp;do...<a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a> you? She would be&nbsp;doing you a&nbsp;favor. She isn’t a&nbsp;good person. She rejected her own daughter twice. She had 30&nbsp;years to&nbsp;correct this and she didn’t.
