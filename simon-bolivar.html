He is often called "El Libertador" (The Liberator) for his role in freeing much of South America from colonial control.</p><p>Bolívar was born into a wealthy family in Caracas, Venezuela. He lost his parents at a young age and was raised by tutors and slaves. His subsequent education in Europe exposed him to Enlightenment ideas, shaping his political views.</p><p>In 1805, Bolívar made a pivotal oath in Rome to free South America from Spanish rule. He began his military career in 1810, fighting for Venezuelan independence. Despite early setbacks, Bolívar persevered and gained victories.</p><p>Bolívar's military campaigns led to the liberation of Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia. The country of Bolivia was named after him. His most notable battles included the Admirable Campaign of 1813 and the Battle of Carabobo in 1821.</p><p>While a skilled military leader, Bolívar also faced political challenges. He dreamed of a united Latin America but encountered unexpected opposition including regional rivalries. Over time, his leadership style eventually became more authoritarian.</p><p>Bolívar's personal life was marked by both tragedy and passion. His wife died young, and he later had a significant relationship with Manuela Sáenz, who once saved his life during an assassination attempt.</p><p>In his final years, Bolívar became disillusioned with his political vision and ultimately died in exile in 1830.</p><p class=info><b>Born:</b> <a href=#>July 24</a>, <a href=#>1783</a><br><b>Birthplace:</b> Caracas, Venezuela<br><b>Star Sign:</b> <a href=#>Leo</a></p><p class="info no-margin-bottom"><b>Died:</b> <a href=#>December 17</a>, <a href=#>1830</a> (aged 47)<br><b>Cause of Death:</b> <a href=#>Tuberculosis</a></p><span class=list-clearfix></span><h2>Articles and Photos</h2><ul class=article-list><li class=article-list__item><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.onthisday.com/images/photos/venezuela-declares-independence.jpg width=270 height=182 alt="Venezuela Declares Independence" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Venezuela Declares Independence</h3><span class=linked_text>A painting by Martin Tovar y Tovar depicting Venezuelan deputies signing the declaration</span><br><span class=linked_date>July 5, 1811</span></a></li></ul><h2>Historical Events</h2><ul class=event-list><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1813-05-23</a> South American independence leader Simón Bolívar enters Mérida, leading the invasion of Venezuela, and is proclaimed El Libertador (The Liberator)</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1813-09-30</a> Battle of Bárbula: Simón Bolívar defeats Santiago Bobadilla</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1822-05-24</a> Battle of Pichincha, Simón Bolívar secures the independence of Ecuador from Spain</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1822-07-26</a> Secret meeting of Simón Bolívar and Jose de San Martin</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1823-09-10</a> Simón Bolívar named President of Peru</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1824-02-10</a> Simón Bolívar named dictator by the Congress of Peru</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1824-08-06</a> Battle at Junan - Simon Bolívar's army defeats the Spanish</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1828-06-13</a> Simon Bolívar proclaimed dictator of Colombia</li><li class=event><a href=# class=date>1829-09-25</a> Failed assassination attempt on Simon Bolívar</li></ul><br><a href=# class=section__link><h2>Famous Venezuelans</h2></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sLrToaCsnJGue6S7zGinnqegobJwv8impqdlkqS5qsLAqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
