The country crooners recently ended up renting a car after cold temperatures affected their plane in the middle of their flight.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-luke-bryan-jason-aldean-detail-tense-plane-emergency-landing-experience>Luke Bryan, Jason Aldean Detail Tense Plane Emergency Landing Experience</h2><p>Bryan and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aldean</a> shared the story via Instagram Live on Friday. Apparently, the pair was supposed to have a 30-minute flight from St. Louis, Missouri when their plane suddenly had problems.</p><p>“Jason and I were flying out of St. Louis when we had some issues traveling with the plane. So we rented a car to go to duck camp. We’re at a Dairy Queen,” Bryan said.</p><p>“Because our plane, we thought was going to fall out of the sky,” Aldean chimed in, causing Bryan to laugh.</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bryan</a> went on to share details of the story, stating that their day began with duck hunting. They then visited a show of Archery Trade Association with Buck Commander to promote a technology launch by the brand. According to the “Country Girl” singer said it was supposed to be an “easy easy” flight to get back home.</p><p>“We took off, and it was so cold in St. Louis, it was like 16 degrees, wind was blowing 40 miles an hour. Some of the instruments on the plan were not … so we had to turn around and land and yeah, it was a little tense,” Bryan said. “So now we’re on I-55 at a Dairy Queen.”</p><p>“We’re getting some chicken fingers. I just peed beside the road. And Jason’s the driver,” he added.</p><p>More specifically, the American Idol Judge ordered “a No. 1 with a Coke.” Aldean, on the other hand, ordered cheeseburger with “cheese and pickles only,” as well as a basket of chicken tenders, fries and a Coca-Cola. Their meal costed $29.78 in total, with Bryan paying the tab.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-two-have-been-good-friends-ever-since>The Two Have Been Good Friends Ever Since</h2><p>It’s no secret that Bryan and Aldean share a strong friendship since years back. Their bond as brothers began during the early days of their careers.</p><p>For those who may not know, the duo collaborated on the track “The Only Way I Know,” featuring Eric Church. Later on, they worked on “Straight To Hell” in 2018 alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Darius Rucker</a> and Charles Kelley.</p><p>In 2023, Aldean surprised Bryan during his 30 No. 1 celebration at Brooklyn Bowl in Nashville. Aldean performed a rendition of Bryan’s “Kiss Somebody Goodbye.”</p><p>“There’s a bond there that I think is hard to describe,” Aldean previously told Rolling Stone. “We hunt together, own a company, and are looking at doing some other stuff too. It’s been a cool friendship.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Original_SofiaVergara_JimmyFallon_Todd-Owyoung_NBC-220x147.jpg alt="Sofia Vergara Reveals She Wants To Stay in NYC Longer Because of Single Men: ‘You Have More Options’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57y66inmWSp8aiuoyjmKynnmKurbDEmqVmr5WjwW67zWaYZqqflrFuwNGip2ackZ6%2FunnQrpyepl2owbC8jJqdrZ2iYr2trc2eZKaZm5rAbrHMnqmgnZ6Yxm64wKeboqaXZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
