American singer Richie Valens recorded his version in 1958. The song was put on the b-side of the record for the English-language single “Donna,” and despite being in Spanish, US radio DJs began to play it. La Bamba was “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the first Latin-based song</a> to cross over to the pop and rock audience” according to NPR.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Volare>2. “Volare” by Domenico Modugno</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Year: 1958</p><p>Language: Italian</p><p>Another hit from 1958 is the Italian song “Volare”.

From there, the song ended up selling over 22 million copies around the world. “Volare” was on the Billboard Hot 100 for five weeks and was the first Grammy winner in 1958 for both Record of the Year and Song of the Year.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Sukiyaki>3. “Sukiyaki” by Kyu Sakamoto</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Year: 1961</p><p>Language: Japanese</p><p>The Japanese-language song “Sukiyaki” was initially called “Ue o Muite Arukō” in Japan.&nbsp;</p><p>Two years after being released in Japan in 1961, the song got to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the US. Sukiyaki was the only song by an Asian artist that reached the top of the Hot 100 chart until BTS put out “Dynamite” 57 years later.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Da-Da-Da>4. “Da Da Da ich lieb dich nicht du liebst mich nicht aha aha aha” by Trio</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Year: 1981</p><p>Language: German&nbsp;</p><p>Known by most as “Da Da Da,” German group Trio’s song “Da Da Da ich lieb dich nicht du liebst mich nicht aha aha aha” achieved a fair amount of success on the charts in over 30 countries; the year after its release, it was No. 2 on the UK charts and No. 3 in Canada.&nbsp;</p><p>The song enjoyed renewed popularity and further success on the charts 15 years later, thanks to a Volkswagen commercial that featured the quirky tune. It’s also been used in movies like Private School, Bio-Dome and Thick as Thieves.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=99-Luftballons>5. “99 Luftballons” by Nena</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Year: 1983</p><p>Language: German</p><p>Released by the band Nena, “99 Luftballons” is a super-catchy <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">German tune</a> that unexpectedly became a protest song for the Cold War. Soon after its release, the song became super successful in Europe and Japan. Following that, “99 Luftballons” topped the charts in both the US and Australia, reaching No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. Though an English version of the song was also released in 1984 and topped the charts in the UK, Ireland and Canada, the German version remained more popular in the US and Australia.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Rock-Me-Amadeus>6. “Rock Me Amadeus” by Falco</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Year: 1985</p><p>Language: German</p><p>Recorded by Austrian singer Falco, “Rock me Amadeus” was inspired by the 1984 movie Amadeus.

It was also one of Virgin Records’ best-selling tracks for years.</p><p>Fun fact: While the bulk of the song is in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">French</a>, there’s also a Gregorian chant in “Sadeness, Part I” that was sung by a Munich-based choir, The Kapelle Antiqua Choir. The choir ended up suing Enigma, who hadn’t gotten their permission to use the sample. They settled out of court.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Macarena>8. “Macarena” by Los Del Río</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Year: 1993</p><p>Language: Spanish&nbsp;</p><p>Before the version of “Macarena” that we all know, there was a less catchy one. Los Del Río’s original song was well-liked in Latin America, but only moderately popular in North America. That would all change soon.</p><p>Florida DJ Caride wanted to play “Macarena” on the radio but the station managers told him he couldn’t play Spanish-only content. Shortly after, two producers recorded English verses to add to the song, as well as remixing it to make it more danceable. That was the birth of the “Macarena (Bayside Boys Mix).” About eight months later, the song hit No. 1 on the Billboard Pop chart.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Danza-Kuduro>9. “Danza Kuduro” by Don Omar</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Year: 2010</p><p>Language: Spanish and Portuguese&nbsp;</p><p>“Danza Kuduro” was recorded by Puerto Rican artist Don Omar with Portuguese-French singer Lucenzo.

By October 2012, Danza Kuduro had sold more than one million digital copies in the US alone.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Gangnam-Style>10. “Gangnam Style” by PSY</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Year: 2012</p><p>Language: Korean</p><p>It would be hard to find someone who hasn’t heard of Korean artist PSY’s catchy parody song “Gangnam Style”—along with his mesmerizing dance moves.
