However, how healthy is&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;fulfill your role as&nbsp;a&nbsp;child and always feel like you have to&nbsp;repay your parents for everything they have done for you? There are some cases, like this <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>Reddit user</a>, where children, when they become adults, must continue to&nbsp;deal with toxic behavior from their parents, which is&nbsp;also not fair.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/329/b49/88b05750e69067dd8166fc7fa8.jpg><p>The situation my&nbsp;mother is&nbsp;going through is&nbsp;entirely her fault, which makes this even more upsetting. She and my&nbsp;stepfather bought a&nbsp;7-bedroom house 10&nbsp;years ago, right after she quit her job of&nbsp;20&nbsp;years to&nbsp;work at&nbsp;a&nbsp;start-up company that closed just 3&nbsp;years later.</p><p>My&nbsp;stepfather spent the last years of&nbsp;his life in&nbsp;bed because he&nbsp;ignored all the doctors who told him to&nbsp;stop eating every moment of&nbsp;the day. So, he&nbsp;died weighing over 485 lbs and in&nbsp;misery. When he&nbsp;passed away earlier this year, he&nbsp;practically used up&nbsp;the last of&nbsp;my&nbsp;mother’s money and now the banks are repossessing her house.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/4fa/db8/3854375236a55f37823f60cbcc.jpg><ul><li>All electronic devices must be&nbsp;turned off by&nbsp;6:00&nbsp;PM. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;catch her using one after that time, I&nbsp;will take it&nbsp;away and sell it&nbsp;at&nbsp;the next garage sale.</li><li>Bedtime is&nbsp;7:30&nbsp;PM. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;find her awake past that time, I&nbsp;will take all the clothes she plans to&nbsp;wear that week.</li><li>She can only shower for 5&nbsp;minutes once every three days.</li><li>All household chores must be&nbsp;done the moment she wakes&nbsp;up. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;get out of&nbsp;bed, and they are not ready, she will not get her meals for the day.</li><li>She must be&nbsp;on&nbsp;the lookout at&nbsp;all times in&nbsp;case my&nbsp;husband, or&nbsp;I need something. If&nbsp;not, she will lose the privilege of&nbsp;sleeping in&nbsp;a&nbsp;bed that night.</li><li>She will be&nbsp;in&nbsp;charge of&nbsp;preparing a&nbsp;meal of&nbsp;my&nbsp;choice every day. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not made to&nbsp;my&nbsp;liking, she will not be&nbsp;allowed to&nbsp;join&nbsp;us at&nbsp;the table and will instead eat the cheapest package of&nbsp;frozen food available.</li><li>I&nbsp;will be&nbsp;reading all her correspondence, text messages, and emails.</li><li>She will have to&nbsp;drive me&nbsp;wherever&nbsp;I want in&nbsp;her car.

My&nbsp;brother called me&nbsp;and told me&nbsp;I have “the biggest balls in&nbsp;the family” for the stunt I&nbsp;pulled. Apparently, none of&nbsp;us want her to&nbsp;move into our homes.

As&nbsp;adults, we&nbsp;have more choices than we&nbsp;had as&nbsp;children, we&nbsp;can make our own decisions and take responsibility for their consequences. We&nbsp;are no&nbsp;longer obligated to&nbsp;always do&nbsp;what our parents tell&nbsp;us to&nbsp;do.</li><li><strong>Don’t try to&nbsp;change them</strong>. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;natural for&nbsp;us to&nbsp;want to&nbsp;please our parents, even in&nbsp;adulthood, but we&nbsp;must also take into account the emotional, physical, mental, financial, and spiritual efforts involved.</li><li><strong>You have to&nbsp;set boundaries</strong>. Just because they are your parents, their priorities should not take precedence over yours.</li><li><strong>You don’t always have to&nbsp;explain yourself</strong>. If&nbsp;you don’t keep in&nbsp;touch with your parents, it&nbsp;helps to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;short explanation if&nbsp;asked about&nbsp;it. Also, this can help you remember why you have set those boundaries, even if&nbsp;others don’t understand them. Likewise, you have the right to&nbsp;say, “I&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;talk about&nbsp;it.”</li><li><strong>Practice self-love</strong>. Children of&nbsp;toxic parents may not be&nbsp;used to&nbsp;taking care of&nbsp;themselves or&nbsp;recognizing that their needs are also important. You can start by&nbsp;writing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;journal to&nbsp;keep a&nbsp;dialogue with yourself and channel your emotions.</li></ul><p>Toxic parents affect one’s adult life greatly and healing doesn’t come in&nbsp;a&nbsp;strike of&nbsp;willpower. But with <a href=#>the right approach</a>, it&nbsp;may turn into a&nbsp;journey to&nbsp;restore your life for the better.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZutMCvnGahnaW8tLHDZqSyZZ2kum6%2F06ugnKxdnby2v8ShpqWcXafCrbHSZqCfZaOdsm7DwKerrGWkpHqttdWeZK6mlJq%2FbrnYZqmop5ZihXKAlW9saA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
