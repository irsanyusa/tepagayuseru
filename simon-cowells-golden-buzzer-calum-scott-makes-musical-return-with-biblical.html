The music video is very simple which is perfect because he is the real star of the show. The reason why people fell in love with Calum on Britain’s Got Talent is that he stuck to his roots and has always remained a very humble artist. “Biblical” is super stripped back with a focus on vocals. We’d like to think the gold jacket Calum is wearing in the video is the perfect homage to the Golden Buzzer that changed his life forever.</p><p>Calum received Simon Cowell’s Golden Buzzer during his groundbreaking 2015 Britain’s Got Talent audition. He performed a chilling version of Robyn’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>“Dancing on My Own”</a> that cemented the song as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener" class=broken_link>a favorite amongst talent show auditioners.</a> His audition garnered over <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">331 million views on YouTube</a>. It has gone down as one of the most unforgettable and viral auditions of all time.</p><p>loading="lazy"</p><p>Even though Calum did not end up winning the show, he did win over the hearts of fans. He signed a deal with Capitol Records after Britain’s Got Talent and marveled at the success of “You Are The Reason” from his Only Human album. The music video for the song has over <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">713 million views</a> on YouTube. He went on to record a duet version of the song with X Factor winner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Leona Lewis.</a></p><p>Fans have since heard “You Are The Reason” performed by America’s Got Talent winner <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Kodi Lee</a> and American Idol runner-up <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Willie Spence</a> who were both joined by Lewis. In March, Calum celebrated the three-year anniversary of Only Human’s release. He also teased that his second album is on the horizon. He has since released a few EP’s here and there but “Biblical” is really the heart of Calum’s second album.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Thumbnail-AGT_Audience_1.jpg alt="Sign Up Now to Reserve Your Spot in the ‘America’s Got Talent’ Live Audience!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Britain's Got Talent</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK570qKkqKZdmLy4sculqmafn6GxprqMm6yzspWneqSty66kZquTpMG1ecyaop6rXaLCtLXCmqNmqpWpwrO6jLCgraBdl7ajuMicmKVn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
