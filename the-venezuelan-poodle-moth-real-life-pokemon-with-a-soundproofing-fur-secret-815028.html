Yep, you heard that right, it’s called the <a href=# title="Taylor Swift" data-link=tag>Taylor Swift</a> millipede as&nbsp;was recently discovered in&nbsp;2022. The scientists behind this finding are said to&nbsp;have named this little critter after the famous singer. They became really attached to&nbsp;her music in&nbsp;their younger years and thought it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;nice homage. The Taylor Swift millipede joins the list of&nbsp;16&nbsp;similar creatures found in&nbsp;the Appalachian Mountains of&nbsp;the United States.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/ae8/4f4/a0a7ec57c48a0880350c340680.png><p>Obviously, the rest of&nbsp;them aren’t as&nbsp;famous. This wasn’t an&nbsp;easy discovery either. These invertebrates are extremely hard to&nbsp;find in&nbsp;their natural habitat since they spend little to&nbsp;no&nbsp;time above the ground. They’d prefer to&nbsp;stay hidden beneath the soil. Since they feed on&nbsp;decaying vegetation, they play a&nbsp;key role in&nbsp;the local natural cycle.</p><p>Another recently discovered species made headlines since it&nbsp;was named after a&nbsp;famous Swedish activist: Greta Thunberg! Her namesake is&nbsp;a&nbsp;frog that lives in&nbsp;eastern Panama. These minuscule frogs live and spend much of&nbsp;their life hidden in&nbsp;bromeliads, which are leafy plants attached to&nbsp;local trees. They hardly ever travel, even sleeping and laying their eggs tucked away. Their most distinctive feature is&nbsp;the fact that they have black eyes, which is&nbsp;unusual for frogs living in&nbsp;Central America. Now how about a&nbsp;chocolate frog? No, it’s not the snack from Harry Potter, it’s a&nbsp;real species. This unusual-looking creature was stumbled upon quite recently, in&nbsp;regions of&nbsp;the Peruvian Amazon.</p><p>It’s also nicknamed the Tapir frog because it&nbsp;resembles this big boy. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;lot to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with the fact that this frog has a&nbsp;long snout. Like other recently discovered species, chocolate frogs are hard to&nbsp;find and study. But it&nbsp;does speak volumes about the incredible biodiversity we’ve yet to&nbsp;uncover from the Amazon area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b7e/8c1/8ab748549482f0cd86c8ba577d.png><p>A&nbsp;new species of&nbsp;cockroach was discovered this year in&nbsp;<a href=# title=Asia data-link=tag>Asia</a>. It&nbsp;was stumbled upon by&nbsp;local authorities when they were looking at&nbsp;logs transported from French Guiana. It&nbsp;might be&nbsp;interesting for local scientists, but this new species needs to&nbsp;be&nbsp;carefully studied as&nbsp;it&nbsp;may be&nbsp;dangerous. When looking at&nbsp;existing records of&nbsp;local cockroaches, local specialists did not find anything similar. They proceeded to&nbsp;study the new insect’s <a href=# title=DNA data-link=tag>DNA</a> and confirmed it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;newly discovered species. Specialists working at&nbsp;customs control around the world continuously monitor deliveries for unknown insects, since they may carry diseases. More&nbsp;so, cockroaches are known to&nbsp;be&nbsp;very adaptable and damaging creatures to&nbsp;new environments. Not to&nbsp;mention they also multiply quite rapidly. To&nbsp;preserve local biodiversity, when insects happen to&nbsp;travel from one location to&nbsp;another, they need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;intensively studied to&nbsp;see if&nbsp;preventive measures need to&nbsp;be&nbsp;taken.</p><p>At&nbsp;the start of&nbsp;2022, a&nbsp;marine biologist stumbled upon a&nbsp;beautiful sea creature. It&nbsp;was later named the blanket octopus, and from what we&nbsp;know so&nbsp;far it&nbsp;lives off the coast of&nbsp;the Great Barrier Reef. This beautifully looking creature got its name because of&nbsp;its rainbow-like appearance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/f55/cd9/172e9554308748bc5f21b88df2.png><p>In&nbsp;most species, the male tends to&nbsp;be&nbsp;larger than the female, but this is&nbsp;not the case for this gorgeous creature. In&nbsp;fact, a&nbsp;female blanket octopus can stretch to&nbsp;6&nbsp;feet long, while most gentlemen in&nbsp;this species are less than 1&nbsp;inch in&nbsp;length on&nbsp;average. Yeah that is&nbsp;bigger. Another beautifully colored creature living in&nbsp;our waters was recently discovered in&nbsp;the Maldives. It’s called the rose-veiled fairy wrasse. This one got its name after the local national flower, which is&nbsp;the pink rose. In&nbsp;all fairness, this fish species is&nbsp;really like the red velvet fairy wrasse, but it&nbsp;does differ a&nbsp;bit in&nbsp;terms of&nbsp;coloring. It’s not the first time we’ve seen&nbsp;it, but it’s the first time we’ve studied it&nbsp;long enough to&nbsp;know they are two distinct species altogether. (crowd: They are two distinct species.) Sorry, I&nbsp;couldn’t help myself.</p><p>Discovered recently by&nbsp;Irish and Indonesian researchers, the Waka Tobi Sunbird is&nbsp;a&nbsp;small creature resembling a&nbsp;hummingbird. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;cool color pattern: blue feathers on&nbsp;the neck, yellow feathers on&nbsp;the belly, and brown feathers on&nbsp;the back and top of&nbsp;the head. The reason why it&nbsp;is&nbsp;named a&nbsp;Sunbird is&nbsp;that its feathers shine like they are covered in&nbsp;glitter in&nbsp;the sunlight. We&nbsp;rarely discover new species of&nbsp;mammals these days, let alone large ones. But the Southern-maned sloth is&nbsp;quite the exception. It&nbsp;was initially believed that maned sloths are part of&nbsp;a&nbsp;single species. Turns out they divide into two distinct categories: northern and southern. They are both found in&nbsp;the Brazilian Atlantic Forest.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/24a/2e4/ffe05157578ca177b4403a3797.png><p>A&nbsp;new owl species called Principe scops-owl was also recently announced by&nbsp;specialists. The main thing that drew researchers to&nbsp;conclude it&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;new type of&nbsp;bird is&nbsp;the distinctive sound it&nbsp;makes. Its call starts with a&nbsp;short “tuu” note. It&nbsp;is&nbsp;then shortly followed by&nbsp;other noises that resemble insect calls. Some owls make this call as&nbsp;a&nbsp;duet at&nbsp;nightfall. Aw... The name comes from the location it&nbsp;has been discovered&nbsp;in, which is&nbsp;Príncipe Island, part of&nbsp;the Democratic Republic of&nbsp;São Tomé and Príncipe. If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;visit, you’ll have to&nbsp;head to&nbsp;the coast of&nbsp;Central Africa. After looking all over the island, the team behind its discovery found out they only roam a&nbsp;small portion of&nbsp;an&nbsp;already small island. It’s easy to&nbsp;estimate there are only a&nbsp;limited number of&nbsp;specimens, so&nbsp;the species has been immediately classified as&nbsp;critically endangered.</p><p>This year, Europeans were also introduced to&nbsp;their brand-new species of&nbsp;slug. And it’s quite impressive too, given it&nbsp;can be&nbsp;as&nbsp;large as&nbsp;a&nbsp;carrot! It&nbsp;features a&nbsp;brown-gray-ish color and was named the Giant keelback slug. The international team responsible for identifying this new species spent a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;time exploring the Tara Canyon, in&nbsp;Montenegro.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1cc/e77/014c86556e93073eff8f70bb43.png><p>An&nbsp;international team of&nbsp;citizen scientists was taking part in&nbsp;a&nbsp;field trip by&nbsp;Taxon Expeditions, and they were exploring Tara Canyon in&nbsp;Montenegro, which is&nbsp;Europe’s largest and deepest canyon. Now technically, The Venezuelan Poodle Moth is&nbsp;yet to&nbsp;be&nbsp;officially identified and fully studied, but ever since it&nbsp;was first photographed in&nbsp;2009, the internet went crazy over its appearance. This tiny insect looks like a&nbsp;combination between a&nbsp;Furby and a&nbsp;gargoyle, but in&nbsp;an&nbsp;extremely cute way.</p><p>We&nbsp;do&nbsp;know it&nbsp;might live in&nbsp;the Gran Sabana region of&nbsp;Venezuela, but apart from that, there’s little to&nbsp;no&nbsp;information on&nbsp;these moths. Scientists have yet to&nbsp;pinpoint exactly its insect family, but they do&nbsp;suspect it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;combination of&nbsp;varied species, like a&nbsp;mutant. Another fun fact: that fur they wear is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;soundproofing cellulose. So, if&nbsp;you think about&nbsp;it, their coat is&nbsp;made of&nbsp;sugar!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4f1/d7f/d35742595eafbf8b678169fe57.png><p>The sponge crab must be&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the most elegant aquatic creatures discovered this year. It&nbsp;has a&nbsp;sponge middle and a&nbsp;fluffy coat and was recently stumbled upon after a&nbsp;specimen was found washed up&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;beach in&nbsp;Denmark, Western Australia. The people that found it&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;beach were nice enough to&nbsp;send it&nbsp;over to&nbsp;researchers at&nbsp;Western Australian Museum, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;could be&nbsp;properly identified and studied. To&nbsp;their surprise, this creature did not seem to&nbsp;resemble anything that was previously documented.</p><p>Nimba Bats got their name from the Nimba Mountains in&nbsp;which they were recently discovered. To&nbsp;visit this region, you’ll have to&nbsp;book a&nbsp;trip to&nbsp;West Africa. They are also called bright orange bats, because of&nbsp;their uniquely colored furry wings. Along with other similar species, they can be&nbsp;only found in&nbsp;this specific region, so&nbsp;it’s crucial to&nbsp;maintain their habitat to&nbsp;make sure they don’t become endangered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4af/1de/a9cb5850ae9e0e223830a9f3eb.png><p>These guys are named nano chameleons, and by&nbsp;their name, you can already tell they’re not the largest reptiles. Also recently discovered in&nbsp;Madagascar, the male nano chameleons are amongst the smallest male reptiles in&nbsp;the world. The female chameleon is&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit larger, but it&nbsp;too doesn’t stretch longer than 1&nbsp;inch, including its tail. Because their natural habitat is&nbsp;very limited in&nbsp;size, there’s still a&nbsp;lot we&nbsp;don’t know about them as&nbsp;they’ve proven quite hard to&nbsp;study. Yeah, they’re shy...</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMGpsYyvnKedqqqyra3NZqeop5Shsm65zq2fZqqVlrluuMifnGaon6CyrrvNZq6irJhirm6%2Fzq6lnaiipLyntc2gZJ%2BtomLApq%2FRnqtmcGFqfXOEjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
