It&nbsp;may not seem like a&nbsp;lot, but that’s more than the total population of&nbsp;Belgium! It’s a&nbsp;great vacation alternative, with an&nbsp;added bonus: you can sample various different destinations for future time-off in&nbsp;one single trip. If&nbsp;you’ve already booked a&nbsp;trip on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cruise ship, but you still have no&nbsp;idea what you should pack, start with some research on&nbsp;your specific cruise locations.</p><p>Either way, be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;bring deck-friendly shoes that are low-heeled. Also, add a&nbsp;pair that’s comfortable to&nbsp;walk on&nbsp;larger distances, for the days spent ashore. Depending on&nbsp;the season, you might want to&nbsp;add a&nbsp;few swimsuits too. If&nbsp;you are on&nbsp;any type of&nbsp;medication, make sure to&nbsp;bring it&nbsp;with you in&nbsp;its original packaging.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/041/b5f/3ec3ac5efe838d076dbd1085c7.png><p>If&nbsp;you’re a&nbsp;light packer, don’t worry. Most cruise ships come equipped with laundry rooms. They are kind of&nbsp;pricey, especially if&nbsp;you want your garments to&nbsp;be&nbsp;washed, ironed, and folded for you, but it&nbsp;does save you the extra hustle of&nbsp;packing more clothes or&nbsp;washing them for yourself. It’s really important that you check in&nbsp;with your credit card company before boarding a&nbsp;ship.</p><p>More&nbsp;so, if&nbsp;your itinerary includes one or&nbsp;more foreign countries. Your credit card might get frozen if&nbsp;there’s any unusual activity in&nbsp;your account. Most of&nbsp;these companies have algorithms that get triggered once there are charges from different countries in&nbsp;rapid succession. Which is&nbsp;exactly what you’ll be&nbsp;doing on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cruise ship. Letting them know beforehand saves you the embarrassment of&nbsp;having your card declined at&nbsp;some fancy restaurant.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/944/010/4e69405773a336f7fe03d04de7.png><p>To&nbsp;make sure you get the best room, before booking it&nbsp;check out the ship’s deck plan. It&nbsp;should be&nbsp;available on&nbsp;their website. If&nbsp;it’s peace and tranquility you’re looking for, don’t go&nbsp;for the rooms directly above or&nbsp;below any of&nbsp;the ship’s entertainment points. Also, if&nbsp;you have a&nbsp;history of&nbsp;getting seasick, try to&nbsp;skip the rooms that are available at&nbsp;the front of&nbsp;the ship. Rather go&nbsp;for those located in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;the ship on&nbsp;a&nbsp;lower deck, you’ll feel less movement. If&nbsp;it’s your first time going on&nbsp;a&nbsp;cruise, you might be&nbsp;surprised to&nbsp;know that some cabin rooms don’t have windows.</p><p>Before making a&nbsp;reservation, make sure to&nbsp;check out all the amenities of&nbsp;the room you intend to&nbsp;book. Most cruise liners add a&nbsp;bunch of&nbsp;pictures from the common rooms on&nbsp;their reservation pages, and it&nbsp;might be&nbsp;a&nbsp;bit confusing as&nbsp;to&nbsp;what you’re getting exactly, for that specific price point. Also, some rooms on&nbsp;board are quite small too. If&nbsp;you don’t like to&nbsp;sleep in&nbsp;small spaces, you might want to&nbsp;upgrade to&nbsp;a&nbsp;larger room, even if&nbsp;it’s a&nbsp;bit pricier. You can always split the cost with a&nbsp;friend if&nbsp;they want to&nbsp;join you on&nbsp;the cruise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/8a6/858/72317c5c5db90aecabf5dfaaef.png><p>With the help of&nbsp;modern technology, even if&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific location doesn’t have windows, it&nbsp;doesn’t mean you can’t watch the waves. How, might you ask? Fancier cruise ships feature a&nbsp;secret, added bonus. In&nbsp;the areas with no&nbsp;access to&nbsp;sunlight, specialists have built virtual balconies. These high-tech screens work by&nbsp;showing you what’s going on&nbsp;outside in&nbsp;real-time. They have an&nbsp;added benefit too: In&nbsp;case of&nbsp;bad weather, guests can still have a&nbsp;feel of&nbsp;the outdoors, without the wind or&nbsp;rain ruining their hair or&nbsp;their outfit. It&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;the real deal, but it&nbsp;still beats getting claustrophobic on&nbsp;board.</p><p>Planning on&nbsp;going on&nbsp;a&nbsp;budget cruise? It&nbsp;might not be&nbsp;such a&nbsp;bad idea. Especially if&nbsp;you’re on&nbsp;the lookout for last-minute upgrades. You might even end up&nbsp;vacationing like a&nbsp;millionaire without having to&nbsp;spend money like one. These upgrades sometimes include things like a&nbsp;private balcony in&nbsp;your room, maybe some spa services, or&nbsp;even better prices for high-end meals. If&nbsp;they aren’t all booked by&nbsp;the time people board the ship, they might be&nbsp;open for the rest of&nbsp;the passengers, for way better prices than initially listed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/4d3/503/ab677a5d0d8b13aa417345d38b.png><p>There might be&nbsp;hidden freebies on&nbsp;board if&nbsp;you pay close attention. Things like complimentary pastries on&nbsp;board late in&nbsp;the morning, or&nbsp;a&nbsp;late-night cup of&nbsp;tea on&nbsp;the house might be&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the things offered to&nbsp;guests... you only need to&nbsp;ask. You might want to&nbsp;check out what other tourists are doing.</p><p>Some people with more experience cruising can offer pretty great tips and tricks. Don’t be&nbsp;afraid to&nbsp;start a&nbsp;conversation if&nbsp;you see someone getting something for free. Some cruise ships do&nbsp;go&nbsp;all the way on&nbsp;the fancy dial. They even have exclusive areas designed for guests staying in&nbsp;expensive suites. Most of&nbsp;the time they’re located at&nbsp;the top of&nbsp;the ship.</p><p>On&nbsp;one particular cruise, these types of&nbsp;guests have designated staff members called Royal Genies, which are similar to&nbsp;butlers. They can cater to&nbsp;just a&nbsp;few cabins. Since the cruise line wants to&nbsp;divert other guests from asking them various questions which will take time away from their assigned guests, the genies do&nbsp;not wear a&nbsp;nametag in&nbsp;public areas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/91a/da6/df07d4546f99796f5e2c7d8261.png><p>Most common areas of&nbsp;cruise ships do&nbsp;require travelers to&nbsp;follow a&nbsp;<a href=# title="dress code" data-link=tag>dress code</a>. But if&nbsp;you do&nbsp;your research in&nbsp;advance, you might find that some areas are more relaxed when it&nbsp;comes to&nbsp;what people need to&nbsp;wear. Most cruise ships require people to&nbsp;adhere to&nbsp;“smart attire,” which means pants with a&nbsp;collared shirt for men, or&nbsp;blouses and skirts, dresses, or&nbsp;stylish pants for the ladies.</p><p>As&nbsp;for the travel destinations, be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;research the ports you’re about to&nbsp;visit in&nbsp;advance. You’ll know what to&nbsp;wear, what the weather will be&nbsp;and if&nbsp;you need to&nbsp;pack anything else, like an&nbsp;umbrella or&nbsp;a&nbsp;beach towel. Stops on&nbsp;cruises only last for a&nbsp;few hours in&nbsp;most cases, so&nbsp;you’ll want to&nbsp;get the most out of&nbsp;them. If&nbsp;that specific location includes museums or&nbsp;art galleries you want to&nbsp;add to&nbsp;your checklist, be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;book in&nbsp;advance, so&nbsp;you don’t waste time waiting in&nbsp;lines.</p><p>Some cruise ships even provide their guests with private tours of&nbsp;the ports they are about to&nbsp;visit. Do&nbsp;make sure to&nbsp;book them in&nbsp;advance if&nbsp;this is&nbsp;something you might be&nbsp;interested&nbsp;in, as&nbsp;the list gets pretty full quite fast. Independent tours are a&nbsp;bit more private. You can spend time with your tour guide and even ask more questions. Always remember to&nbsp;put your phone in&nbsp;airplane mode while on&nbsp;board.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/1c6/81e/714eec5b31babe5748d8b6733a.png><p>Most cruise ship horror stories involve cruising newbies that ended up&nbsp;paying thousands of&nbsp;dollars in&nbsp;cell phone charges while on&nbsp;ships, just because they forgot to&nbsp;turn it&nbsp;off. If&nbsp;you’re the type of&nbsp;person that can’t switch off their phone, be&nbsp;sure to&nbsp;check with your cell phone provider before traveling internationally. Some can provide special plans for limited amounts of&nbsp;time, without extra charges.</p><p>You’ll be&nbsp;free to&nbsp;chat, call or&nbsp;browse YouTube videos without worrying you’ll end up&nbsp;paying a&nbsp;fortune. Most cruise ships also provide you with complimentary Wi-Fi or&nbsp;Wi-Fi packages that can be&nbsp;purchased in&nbsp;advance, which are way more affordable. You can stick to&nbsp;communicating with your friends and family back home via FaceTime or&nbsp;Skype.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/b60/167/ca9ffb5a1fb917b1f466059f1c.png><p>People that have heard about the Titanic tragedy will always wonder what might happen if&nbsp;something goes wrong while on&nbsp;board. Let’s take lifeboats, for instance. The Titanic had a&nbsp;mere 20&nbsp;lifeboats on&nbsp;board, which were tragically not enough to&nbsp;fit all the passengers after the ship hit the iceberg.</p><p>Some fancy cruise ships these days have an&nbsp;even lower number of&nbsp;lifeboats, anywhere from 15&nbsp;to&nbsp;18. Sounds strange? Well, not really, given the fact that each lifeboat can accommodate up&nbsp;to&nbsp;370&nbsp;people. Even the largest ships&nbsp;— which have an&nbsp;estimated capacity of&nbsp;8,000 people if&nbsp;fully booked, including tourists and staff&nbsp;— are safe in&nbsp;case of&nbsp;an&nbsp;emergency.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZMSpxYycqa6ho5p6tLTIqapmoJGrsm6yxLCcq2WcnrOmrs6aq6xlpJ2ur3nToZxmrJmprq%2B1wmZvam1hbYJw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
