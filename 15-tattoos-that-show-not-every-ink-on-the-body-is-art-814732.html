An&nbsp;unsuccessful <a href=# title=design data-link=tag>design</a>, of&nbsp;course, can be&nbsp;removed, but this procedure is&nbsp;painful and expensive. We&nbsp;experienced a&nbsp;whole range of&nbsp;emotions when we&nbsp;read stories from people who got or&nbsp;saw tattoos, whose meaning was unclear to&nbsp;others.</p><ul><li>An&nbsp;older woman had a&nbsp;whole back tiger tattoo. It&nbsp;had “Leo’s forever” and their birthdates on&nbsp;the bottom. I&nbsp;asked her about&nbsp;it, and she told me&nbsp;she and her sister were both Leo’s. I&nbsp;didn’t have the heart to&nbsp;tell her she had a&nbsp;full-back tattoo of&nbsp;the wrong cat.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Bearacolypse&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>My&nbsp;current boss has a&nbsp;tattoo in&nbsp;Chinese that she got when she was 18. What does it&nbsp;say? “Italian.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;douggold11&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;was curious about what it&nbsp;meant, but&nbsp;I didn’t want to&nbsp;be&nbsp;rude. The girl had a&nbsp;teapot tattooed on&nbsp;her leg. It&nbsp;was a&nbsp;simple design, with a&nbsp;lid, a&nbsp;handle, and steam coming out of&nbsp;the spout. I&nbsp;stared at&nbsp;the teapot, wondering if&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;hidden message behind it&nbsp;until the bus arrived.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/06a/ffc/e1f9ca5005877f8381eca395d0.jpg><p>“I&nbsp;mostly just regret how large&nbsp;I got this one.”</p><ul><li>My&nbsp;ex&nbsp;got a&nbsp;wolf tattoo on&nbsp;his chest. OMG, it&nbsp;had crossed eyes and a&nbsp;fat weird face and for some reason, pine trees embedded in&nbsp;the fur. Ugh. Just, whyyy... <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;GabriellaJeremiah&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>My&nbsp;ex-husband got his company’s repo truck tattooed on&nbsp;his back. Massive. Even the phone number is&nbsp;clearly on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;the vehicle. He&nbsp;doesn’t even drive the repo trucks. He&nbsp;works from home and tells the guys where to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;look for the vehicles.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;LoveDietCokeMore&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Had a&nbsp;coworker who wanted to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;set of&nbsp;tattoos. The series of&nbsp;tattoos she got were ladybugs, representing her <a href=# title=kids data-link=tag>kids</a> and her parents, all on&nbsp;various parts of&nbsp;her body. One was on&nbsp;her chest, right above the spot for a&nbsp;mid-low cut top. Another was on&nbsp;the inside of&nbsp;her lower arm. They all looked horrible. No&nbsp;way did they look like ladybugs, not even right after she had them done.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;RedHeadedStepDevil&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d20/48a/2c16835d6ca00afe98bfaa9c39.jpg><ul><li>Not a&nbsp;tattoo artist, but a&nbsp;friend of&nbsp;my&nbsp;cousin has the words “Your Name” tattooed on&nbsp;his body. So&nbsp;he&nbsp;goes around at&nbsp;bars betting people that he&nbsp;has “Your Name”. This man makes some decent money off of&nbsp;people.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;TheBrutalLad&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;high school with a&nbsp;kid with the last name “Strong”. On&nbsp;his 18th birthday, he&nbsp;got “only the Strong survive” in&nbsp;script across his chest. Strong was spelled wrong. The tattoo was saying, “Only the Strang survive.”<strong> </strong><a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;pearsmir13&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Not an&nbsp;artist but the guy&nbsp;I went to&nbsp;told me&nbsp;about someone who repeatedly came into the shop and only ever wanted sort of&nbsp;natural marks on&nbsp;his body circled. One day he&nbsp;shaved off his beard, found a&nbsp;spot or&nbsp;mole on&nbsp;his chin, and came in&nbsp;that day to&nbsp;have it&nbsp;circled.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;HarisAhmed95&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/2c7/5a5/d5433a58fcb5e9a60ecfcd4fc9.jpg><p>I love this, it's cute.</p><p>“Cover-up ideas for poor Nugget?”</p><ul><li>Once we&nbsp;got a&nbsp;lady who was 8&nbsp;months pregnant and who wanted her baby’s due date down her spine. What if&nbsp;the baby was early or&nbsp;late? After some back and forth with the artist saying he&nbsp;was not comfortable with her being so&nbsp;close to&nbsp;due, they came to&nbsp;an&nbsp;agreement to&nbsp;put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the side of&nbsp;her neck.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;C-Horsey&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>My&nbsp;father’s friend had a&nbsp;portrait of&nbsp;<a href=# title="Angelina Jolie" data-link=tag>Angelina Jolie</a> tattooed on&nbsp;his shoulder. I&nbsp;don’t know how and why, but after that, he&nbsp;divorced his wife.</li><li>I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;undergo surgery recently. I&nbsp;was trembling all over and feeling awful. An&nbsp;old nurse took my&nbsp;hand to&nbsp;insert a&nbsp;catheter and exclaimed with genuine admiration, “Oh, how lovely!” She was referring to&nbsp;my&nbsp;space pineapple tattoo.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/76f/caf/213bd5535090a950fbd96c93ab.png><p>“My&nbsp;first and only tattoo. It&nbsp;seemed like a&nbsp;good idea when&nbsp;I was&nbsp;18.”</p><ul><li>My&nbsp;friend is&nbsp;a&nbsp;tattoo artist who creates amazing 3D&nbsp;images on&nbsp;the skin. Her son, who studies away from home, came to&nbsp;visit her. She was appalled by&nbsp;the terrible tattoos he&nbsp;had on&nbsp;his arm&nbsp;— crooked words and ugly drawings.<br>—&nbsp;Mom, they were done by&nbsp;a&nbsp;great artist.<br>—&nbsp;If&nbsp;you ever regret them, come to&nbsp;me. I’ll either fix them or&nbsp;cover them&nbsp;up.<br>She later told&nbsp;me:<br>—&nbsp;Why did he&nbsp;choose such awful designs? He&nbsp;could have waited for&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;would have given him a&nbsp;beautiful one during the holidays.</li><li>A&nbsp;girl in&nbsp;our office has a&nbsp;tattoo on&nbsp;her neck that she thinks is&nbsp;cool. It&nbsp;has birds and the Latin phrase “Per aspera ad&nbsp;astra”, which means “Through hardships to&nbsp;the stars.” But for some reason, the last three words are written as&nbsp;one word and a&nbsp;letter is&nbsp;missing. I&nbsp;wonder why she picked this design. Did she not notice the spelling error?</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/png/a99/b4c/416baf5951aa31e650db9bb864.png><p>“My&nbsp;wife doesn’t draw. She drew me&nbsp;a&nbsp;camel. So&nbsp;I&nbsp;got it&nbsp;tattooed. Love her.”</p><ul><li>I&nbsp;had some friends from Israel visiting&nbsp;me. I&nbsp;was walking down the street with their son when&nbsp;I ran into a&nbsp;neighbor who had a&nbsp;huge tattoo in&nbsp;Hebrew on&nbsp;her leg. We&nbsp;chatted for a&nbsp;bit, and the son of&nbsp;my&nbsp;friend read the tattoo carefully and whispered to&nbsp;me&nbsp;that it&nbsp;was wrong.<br>I&nbsp;told her what he&nbsp;said, but she snapped at&nbsp;me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;was lying and that the tattoo was correct. To&nbsp;be&nbsp;honest, I&nbsp;trust the Hebrew skills of&nbsp;a&nbsp;Jewish kid more than a&nbsp;Spanish tattoo artist.&nbsp;©&nbsp;Elena Elena</li><li>I&nbsp;got a&nbsp;tattoo on&nbsp;my&nbsp;left wrist, over the protruding bone, when&nbsp;I was 16&nbsp;years old. I&nbsp;thought it&nbsp;was very cool. It&nbsp;said “No&nbsp;fear” in&nbsp;a&nbsp;fancy font.<br>When I&nbsp;turned 20, I&nbsp;started working in&nbsp;an&nbsp;office. We&nbsp;had to&nbsp;wear a&nbsp;uniform&nbsp;— white top, black bottom. And often, rude customers would ask&nbsp;me, “What does that say, girl?” I&nbsp;got sick of&nbsp;it&nbsp;by&nbsp;the time&nbsp;I was&nbsp;25, and the ink had faded anyway. I&nbsp;decided to&nbsp;get rid of&nbsp;the embarrassing tattoo.</li></ul><p>Even <a href=#>celebrities</a> sometimes regret the tattoos and cover them with new ones or&nbsp;remove them altogether.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH52edOaq62nn6h6tbTArWSsoJ%2Bseq%2B702acr52irnqquspmpqdlpJ2ybq7OnbBmoaNirrPAjHFobW9jZ3w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
