This came after singer Charli XCX vented her frustrations amid not getting a nomination for her album.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Grimes Comforts Charli XCX, Slams the Grammys</h2><p>Transpired in Los Angeles, California on Sunday, the 65th Annual Grammy Awards have successfully given recognition to its respective winners. Yet, despite the public’s great feedback, some artists have also taken the time to release their bitter sentiments over the awards night.</p><p>Charli XCX posted on Instagram with her selfie and paired the same with a controversial caption. The singer particularly expressed her disappointment over the fact that her album Crash didn’t receive a nod for the show.</p><p>“Me not being nominated for a grammy for crash is like mia goth not being nominated for an oscar for pearl and only further proves that people don’t wanna see hot evil girls thrive,” she wrote.</p><p>Grimes, who seemingly shared the same opinion, has responded in the comments to comfort Charli. Shockingly, the 34-year-old musician claimed that the Recording Academy has made a pre-fabricated list of nominees.</p><p>“The Grammies are so irrelevant I wouldn’t even sweat it,” she said. “I stopped even clocking them in any capacity when I Was on the producer of the year board and they quite literally would not allow me to nominate anyone who wasn’t on a pre fabricated list that was exceptionally boring.”</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Grimes</a>, she tried to nominate the late electronic music pioneer Sophie when before but got rejected for it. She also claimed that at the time, she said that she was one among the three women and the only person under 40.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-agree-with-her-statements>Fans Agree with Her Statements</h2><p>Upon having such claim, several fans went to Instagram and Twitter to express their agreement in Grimes’ claims. Apparently, many people think that Grimes is right.</p><p>“Grammy fake af,” one user wrote.</p><p>Meanwhile, some supporters are begging grimes to “spill the tea” as regards the issue. On the other hand, there were users who willingly agreed about the insignificance of the Grammys.</p><p>As of writing, the Recording Academy hasn’t responded to Grimes’ accusations yet. For those who may not know, Grimes herself hasn’t receive a Grammy nod yet. Be that as it may, having one will seemingly not impress the singer as she has already fixed her mind about the awards show.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Original_SimonCowell_Child_viaIG-220x147.jpg alt="Simon Cowell is Okay After Reportedly Getting Set on Fire on ‘BGT’" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Alter Ego</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Grimes</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57xqugpp2jYsGpvs6wqmarmJaxpnnArWStoJVitLOtzKawrGWWpL9utMCvoKefXZZ6sb7EZp2amqKesKLAxJ1kpaGjqXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
