So, why do I hate braided wigs so much?</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-3>1. We can clearly see the net holes</h3></p><p>Do you know how tacky it is to see the net used in making the wig? We can see your scalp and the net-like wig cap, which begs the question, what's the point? If it’s supposed to be like real braids, then why do we see those little holes?</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-09351ec9-37fd-48b5-8958-7c1f8ef5a4c0 data-caption="Braided wigs don't look like real hair [Afrikea]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/Q0_ktkpTURBXy80MDdhYjMzN2UzMDI2ZjE4NGE1NDJlNDMzOWEyMGQ4ZS5qcGeRlQLNAt_NAuLCww></span><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-6>2. The frontal and the baby hairs are ugly</h3></p><p>I am not going to mince words; those frontal braided wigs are very ugly, especially those with baby hairs. Baby hairs on their own looks tacky and very low-class; now imagine them on braided wigs. The worst thing is those wigs that don't rest properly on the head and look swollen.</p><p><h3 class="heading-h3 replaced-h1" id=nav-ring-8>3. Most braided wigs don’t look like real braids</h3></p><p>Braided wigs are nothing but cheap imitations and really don’t deserve to exist. If the point of braided wigs is the similitude of braids, then a cheap-looking imitation is probably not the way to go. If you want to make box braids that look really nice, you have to go through the painstaking process of going to the beauty saloon.</p><p>ADVERTISEMENT</p><span class=image-holder data-fancybox=images-87a8d2c4-1c67-415e-b2b3-b426a83d99d5 data-caption="Real braids look much better [naturalgirlwigs]"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ocdn.eu/pulscms-transforms/1/4YAktkpTURBXy8zYjgyZTVjNjQ2ZjI2OWJhMDM0Y2JlNWFkNjdjNjcwNi5qcGeRlQLNAljNAljCww></span><p>Real braids takes a lot of time to make, often six to twelve hours. By the time you are done, your butt will ache and you might have a headache. Not to mention how annoying it is to loosen braids.</p><p>Real braids are also quite expensive. Hair extensions aren’t as cheap as they used to be, and the cost of braiding has skyrocketed. Have you watched those "Let's go make my braids at so and so place" videos on Instagram? Those braids usually cost about ₦50,000 to ₦100,000.</p><p>Notwithstanding, there is no gain without pain, and beauty hurts. To actually look beautiful, you have to go through the process of looking beautiful—no cheap shortcuts, which is what braided wigs are.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7scHLrJxnppdkuaqyxKyrsqSVZK%2BmrdStsGaglZa5tbSOsJ%2ByZZlitaLAxGaZq5mZmbKledainqxlkaOxbsPAp6tmrJiaum6ty6Vkm62io7Kle8GmsHKvZ6w%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
