They are funny, unconscious things, and there are usually a few common ones in every language.</p><p>When taken literally, they often sound ridiculous, but it’s a bit of a window into someone else’s world when you hear their private, sweet name for someone. Choose your moment, though. You’ll get some funny looks if you call your barista ‘babycakes’.</p><p>We compiled for you some lists of pet names in English and French, so you can see for yourself how sweet names can be different from one country to another!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=English-sweetness>English sweetness</h2><p>In English, there are lots of variations of ‘sweet’:</p><ul><li>Sweetheart</li><li>Sweetie</li><li>Sweetness</li><li>Sweetcheeks</li></ul><p>It’s not uncommon to go the baby route with your significant other, too:</p><ul><li>Baby</li><li>Babycakes</li><li>Babe</li><li>Bae</li></ul><p>All of these names can be used for any <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">gender</a>, too. Referring to the attractiveness of your romantic partner is also good:</p><ul><li>Beautiful</li><li>Cutie</li><li>Cutie pie</li><li>Handsome</li></ul><p>Food always seems to make an appearance in any language, and in English ‘pie’ pops up in:</p><ul><li>Cutie pie</li><li>Sweetie pie</li><li>Honey pie</li><li>And even pudding pie</li></ul><p>‘Sugar’ and ‘honey’ are pretty self-explanatory in the sweetness department.</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">UK</a>, they seem to be fond of birds, because loved ones are called: ‘hen’ or ‘duck’ quite often, especially in the north of England. And of course, calling someone ‘love’ spells it out quite nicely.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=Common-French-terms-of-endearment>Common French terms of endearment</h2><p>In French, you can call your loved one:</p><ul><li>Mon amour (my love)</li><li>Mon trésor (my treasure)</li><li>Mon/ma chéri(e) (my darling)</li><li>Mon bébé (my baby)</li></ul><p>These are the most common affectionate names in France. It’s worth noting that the possessive of mon/ma goes with all of these pet names more often in French, but that’s not necessarily the case in English.</p><p>You can add -et or -ette to something to make it little and cute, for example, ma chouquette (my little pastry, literally).</p><p>You can also pop petit(e) before the noun to accomplish this as well. Mon petit chou is a very common phrase, for example.</p><p>Of course, there is also the catch-all of mamour a shortened version of mon/m’ amour (literally, my love), and mon cœur (my heart).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=French…-Birdiness?>French… Birdiness?</h2><p>The French go in for lots of birds as well, with, for example:</p><ul><li>Mon canard (my duck)</li><li>Mon poulet (my chicken)</li><li>Mon poussin (my chick)</li><li>Ma caille (my quail)</li></ul><p>There are a few pet names in French that don’t really have a translation, like doudou and lolotte, but they feel quite nice to say in a sweet voice, so they work!</p><p>In the lost in translation department, there’s ma puce (literally, my flea) which is generally only used to refer to a woman. But French people are not the only ones to be crazy about pet names, Germans are too!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Watch out for pet names in England or France!</h2><p>Listening out for funny pet names is an excellent way to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">learn more about a language</a>, see if you can catch one out in the wild! For example, when traveling or going to a restaurant. Maybe you’ll soon find your favorite and use it for your loved one!</p><p><h2 class=headline>Ready to start learning with Lingoda?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.lingoda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Erin-2-2.jpeg><h2>Erin McGann</h2><p>Erin McGann is a Canadian freelance writer focusing on travel, living abroad, parenting, history, and culture.
