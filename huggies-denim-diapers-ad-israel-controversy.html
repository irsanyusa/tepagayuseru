In the video, child models accessorize their underpants-jeans with sunglasses, straw hats and guitars. A girl baby adjusts a boy’s bow tie. Another sticks her chest out in one shot, and poses with legs apart and finger in her mouth in another. The 20 second spot is set to music that sounds like a rip-off of Madonna’s 1990 hit, “Vogue,” and had this been shown to me without a timestamp, I’d have guessed the ad was produced around the same time, rather than now.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">These little kids seem to move more awkwardly than sexually, as small people tend to do, but that’s not how some Israeli parents feel about the ads.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">One local father compared the baby models frozen on billboards to the come-hither pose of Israeli model, Bar Refaeli on a nearby advertisement, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>Vocativ</a>. One Tweeter said the campaign belongs in the Red Light District, while another simply said “@huggies WTF?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Maybe selling something on the backs of provocatively dressed little people is new for Israel, but not for America where, since the 90s, we have become quite skilled at it. <a href=#>JonBenet Ramsey </a>begat TLC’s <a href=# rel=noopener>Toddlers and Tiaras</a>, which has long had the dolled up toddler crown on lock. That fixation produced the beloved <a href=# rel=noopener>Honey Boo Boo</a>, whose unique brand and zany family earned her a show of her own.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Not long ago, <a href=# rel=noopener>Vogue Paris </a>was skewered for a spread that depicted little girls in kitten heels, makeup and sultry pouts. <a href=# rel=noopener>Gwyneth Paltrow</a> drew ire over an exclusive line of ruffly kiddie bikinis designed for her lifestyle bible, Goop. Dolls from Barbie to Bratz have been deemed too sexualized for child’s play, but they’re still available for purchase.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Compared to all of the above, these poorly produced Huggies ads seem distasteful, yet tame.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZqa2hrgXZ7x66eoKGVqHqlsc2ipGacmZa9pr7SZpidZZmov6Kxy2aaqKakp7y3sdGssGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
