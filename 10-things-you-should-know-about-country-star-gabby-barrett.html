It’s no secret that she’s approaching country music superstar status in 2022.</strong></p><p>This singer has translated her powerful voice and infectious performance style from American Idol into a career. In the recent years, she’s gained a lot of popularity. Here’s ten things to know about this accomplished young country singer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-1-she-started-competing-in-singing-competitions-at-a-young-age>1. She Started Competing in Singing Competitions At a Young Age</h2><p>Barrett took to the American Idol stage at 19 years old. Right away, it was obvious that she was confident and filled with personality. Barrett was excited, but the judges thought she didn’t have enough of an original sound. After hearing a song from church they agreed to take a chance on this singer.</p><p>It’s possible that Barrett’s confidence came from winning a local singing competition at 14 years old. It’s been reported that the local contest is called Kean Quest Talent <a href=#>Search</a>. Before American Idol she was performing on small local stages. Some reports state that this singer began singing in front of crowds at only <a href=#>9 years old</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-2-barrett-turned-to-carrie-underwood-after-struggling-to-get-a-record-deal>2. Barrett Turned to Carrie Underwood After Struggling To Get A Record Deal</h2><p>This singer finished out American Idol and knew she had what it took to become the next female country star. As the third place winner, she had to seek out record deal opportunities on her own. This singer had a tough time finding a record deal after finishing the competition. She contributed this to the fact that she only sang covers in the competition. When times got tough, she turned to fellow American Idol alum, Carrie Underwood for tips. After receiving the tips, Barrett put in hard work. She impressed American with her debut single “I Hope.” Due to her single success, she <a href=#>signed</a> with Warner Music Nashville.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>3. She Married A Fellow American Idol Alum</h2><p>Barrett met her husband, Cade Foehner during her time on the American Idol competition. Before the competition, Foehner was in a band called Johnson’s Lost Crowes. The group performed together in bars in 2020 while the <a href=#>members</a> were in 8th grade. Barrett and Foehner got married soon after the competition in 2019. In early 2021, the couple had their first child, Baylah May Foehner.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>4. She Won CMT’s Award for Artist of The Year in 2021</h2><p>This country star gained recognition for dominating country music in 2021. CMT honored her, Kane Brown, Kelsea Ballerini, Chris Stapleton, and Luke Combs for their chart-topping music in the year. The network based this honor on both chart success and the capability of creating fan connection amid the pandemic. After receiving this award, Barrett sang her song “The Good Ones” on the CMT stage with her husband on guitar.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>5. She’s Touring With Jason Aldean in 2022</h2><p>On February 14, Barrett announced that she would be joining Jason Aldean’s upcoming 2022 tour. She will be on this tour for the entire four months along with John Morgan and Dee Jay Silver. Barrett’s fans quickly shared their excitement for the upcoming tour.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>6. She Was Apart of CMT’s Next Women of Country Class of 2020</h2><p>Barrett finished American Idol in 2018 and began making a name for herself soon after. Due to her post Idol success, she was named to CMT’s Next Women of Country class of 2020. CMT recognizes a set of female artists yearly to be apart of their Next Women of Country Class. Being added to this list means that the country artists are on the path to ultimate country music stardom. Before Barrett, other notable American Idol alum like Lauren Alaina, Kelsea Ballerini, and others were named to this list.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>7. She Recently Dropped the Deluxe Version of her Album, Goldmine</h2><p>Barrett’s debut 13 track album, Goldmine, was released in 2020. Due to the success of this album, Barrett released a deluxe version a year later. The deluxe version features four added songs, “Pick Me Up,” “Never Get it Back,” “I Will Always Love You,” and “The Good Ones (Wedding Version).”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p>loading="lazy"</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>8. She Premiered a New Look in Late 2021</h2><p>Barrett went on to American Idol with her staple platinum blonde hair. After the competition fans recognized her by this staple. In late 2021, fans noticed that Barrett’s hair looked a bit different. Now, she has beautiful brunette hair with highlights.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>9. She is Co-Hosting the Academy of Country Music (ACM) Awards with Jimmie Allen and Dolly Parton</h2><p>Barrett is taking to the stage alongside fellow American Idol alum <a href=#>Jimmie Allen</a> as the co-hosts to Dolly Parton for the 57th ACM Awards. This is a major career move for both of the alum. On top of co-hosting this event with the music icon, Barrett has a nomination for Female Artist of the Year. This award show will be streamed exclusively on Amazon Prime Video on March 7, 2022.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>10. She Didn’t Win American Idol</h2><p>Although it’s already been mentioned, I think it’s important to note that Barrett didn’t win American Idol. This country star finished in third place in season 16 and has gone on to achieve great success on the country charts. She’s another example of an artist from this competition who didn’t need to win to become successful.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/160941_5448-2.jpg alt="‘American Idol’ Recap: Judges Think They’ve Found Season 20’s Star" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>gabby barrett</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57kGlkraCZo7S0ediorGarmKTCrbCMpKWor12Wr7DB02aaqK2eqb%2B6edKtmKtll5avo8WMm5irqpWpwXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
