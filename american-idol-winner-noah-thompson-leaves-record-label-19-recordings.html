The 22-year-old is not the first Idol alum to break with the label, which has exclusive rights to sign contestants from the show.</strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-american-idol-winner-noah-thompson-breaks-with-record-label>American Idol Winner Noah Thompson Breaks with Record Label</h2><p>As of this writing, Thompson doesn’t appear to have shared the news on social media, but 19 Recordings confirmed with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Heavy</a> last week that “Noah Thompson is no longer on our roster.” Season 20 runner-up HunterGirl appears to still be signed with the label.</p><p>As part of his time on Idol, Thompson recorded his first single, called “One Day Tonight.” He also put out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">a duet version with HunterGirl</a>. Thompson later moved to Nashville to further his music career, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">releasing his first EP</a> with 19 Recordings called Middle of God Knows Where.</p><p>“Noah is currently in a transition period in his career but rest assured he is working on some of the best music of his career and will have lots of exciting announcements soon,” a rep for Thompson told Heavy after the news broke that he had parted with his label.</p><p class=has-text-align-left><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">NOAH THOMPSON RECALLS EMBARRASSING MOMENT ON ‘AMERICAN IDOL’</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-have-expressed-concern-about-thompson>Fans Have Expressed Concern About Thompson</h2><p>Thompson toured to promote his EP, with shows running into 2024. However, Heavy points out that the singer went relatively quiet on social media after that. Then earlier this month, he posted photos of himself with his new motorcycle.</p><p>“When life gets you down, you buy a Harley,” Thompson wrote to caption the post, which includes a clip of himself riding the bike without a helmet. This inspired fans to comment their concerns about the singer’s safety, urging him to take precautions.</p><p>Fans were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">also concerned</a> after Thompson posted photos with his friend Arthur Johnson, who was recently arrested on drug charges. One fan commented that the singer was “not looking healthy.”</p><p>Thompson is apparently still working on music, as he recently had a songwriting session with Luke Levenson, who posted that they were “writing bangers.” The singer is also scheduled to perform at a festival in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, on June 14.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Original_BrunoTonioli_AleshaDixon_AmandaHolden_SimonCowell_Stuart-C.-Wilson_Getty-Images-220x147.jpg alt="‘Britain’s Got Talent’ Could See a Big Format Change Next Year" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class=title-post-tagcloud>Tags</span> <a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>American Idol</a><a class=tagcloud-tag href=#>Noah Thompson</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57wKacq6GTlrtutcOoo2avmaO7pr6Mp6aaoF2ptbC5z6ymp2Wcmq63sdJmqZ6bn6exbrjAm5ylZWFuerOxwqipnaGenMBw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
