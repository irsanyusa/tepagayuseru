His character is portrayed as a hardcore gamer, before hockey comes calling.</p><p>In the show’s fourth episode, “Hockey Moms,” Islam’s singing talents are highlighted. In a hilarious scene, Koob sings “I Dreamed a Dream” from Les Miserables in a scheme to distract their mothers.</p><p>“I am so incredibly honored to have the opportunity to showcase my vocals!” Islam&nbsp;said in an <a href=#>interview.</a> “I started off as a singer so it’s really cool for me. Can’t wait for everyone to see it!”</p><p>The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers is one of the many reboots and revivals in the works at Disney +.

Islam shared that he has been following the judge’s dancing career for quite some time. When his performance was over, he was greeted with a standing ovation from the entire room, as well as an emotional response from Hough herself.
