You Obtain a Certificate of Registration</h2><p class=align-left>When you successfully register your business with the Corporate Affairs Commission, you receive your Certificate of Registration and Status Report Document. This certificate comes in handy for various authentication and verification processes.</p><p class=align-left>Fortunately, you <a href=#>can</a> obtain your CAC e-certificate without walking into a nearby CAC office by registering online on the CAC website or a Fintech banking mobile app like the Moniepoint Business Banking App.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/98f881fa292c335f.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Subject combination for business administration for 2024/2025 admission</span></p></a><h2>2. Boost Your Businesses' Credibility</h2><p class=align-left>Gaining the utmost trust and loyalty of your customers is essential for the growth of your venture.</p><p class=align-left>Registering your business with the CAC boosts its trustworthiness, thereby making your customers and investors more at ease.

Saves your Business from Liabilities and Sanctions</h2><p class=align-left>Operating your business with a registered business name is compulsory in <a href=#>Nigeria</a>, and doing so can free your business from sanctions.</p><p class=align-left>Registering your business with the CAC protects your business from shady operations by scammers who might pretend to be you.</p><p class=align-left>Additionally, registering your business as a public or private company enables your business to become a separate legal entity.
