The 28-year-old singer <a href=#>has been saved twice</a> by her coach Blake Shelton, who loves her classic country style.</strong></p><p>First, Shelton <a href=#>saved Lana in the Battles</a> when she lost to fellow team member Hailey Green. Hailey was later eliminated in the Knockouts, but Lana stayed on Blake’s team. When it came time to choose an artist to go to the Top 13, he opted to save Lana once again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-voice-star-lana-scott-draws-inspiration-from-her-grandma>‘The Voice’ Star Lana Scott Draws Inspiration from Her Grandma</h2><p>Lana is originally from Chesapeake, Virginia, but she currently lives in Pasadena, California. According to her <a href=#>The Voice bio</a>, Lana grew up performing in musical theater and singing in church. She was named after her grandmother, who encouraged her to pursue country music.</p><p>Lana attended Berklee College of Music in Boston before leaving school to become a cruise ship performer, which she did for three years. After that, she moved to California to chase her dream of becoming a country singer. Sadly, her grandmother passed away three months after she made the move.</p><p>“As a country singer, I get asked a lot, ‘Well, why didn’t you move to Nashville?'” Lana said before her Blind Audition. “I think being surrounded by different artists of different genres keeps me more on my toes.”</p><p>Lana lives in a house with her two roommates and their three chickens named Tallulah, Nico, and Milano. She explained that the chickens hang out in their yard like cats, and their neighbors like to take selfies with them.</p><p>The singer told <a href=# class=broken_link>local news</a> that her two biggest musical inspirations are Faith Hill and Maren Morris, referring to “the musicality and the songwriting aspect and the power of the singing in country music that hasn’t changed.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" readability=2><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyZi-htov1s</p></figure><p class=has-text-align-center><strong>SEE ALSO: <a href=#>WHY BLAKE SHELTON SAVED ‘THE VOICE’ ARTIST LANA SCOTT TWICE THIS SEASON</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lana-calls-her-fans-lanterns>Lana Calls Her Fans ‘Lanterns’</h2><p>This wasn’t Lana’s first time auditioning for The Voice. In fact, she told <a href=# class=broken_link>local news</a> that Season 21 was actually her sixth time trying out, adding, “Perseverance pays off.” She said she’s dreamed of competing on the show for over a decade, and now it’s finally come true.</p><p>Before her Blind Audition, Lana shared that her dad is a huge Blake Shelton fan. However, she also said she would be thrilled to have Kelly Clarkson turn her chair for her. Those happened to be the two coaches who turned around for her. Lana chose to join Team Blake, and he’s been her coach for the whole season.</p><p>Shelton recently suggested that Lana’s fans should be called “Fanas,” but Lana prefers to call them “Lanterns.” As she explained on <a href=#>Instagram</a> last month, her name means “light,” and she wants her fans to remember that “YOU have a light inside.”</p><p>So how does Lana deal with nerves? She said in an <a href=#>interview</a> that she does a “happy dance” to move her body, which “makes for a fun moment backstage.” She also listens to a worship song before each performance, explaining, “I know I’m loved. I know I’m enough, no matter what happens.”</p><p>If you can’t get enough of Lana’s voice from her performances on the show, you can check out her <a href=#>YouTube channel</a>, where she’s uploaded a few cover performances of artists like Maren Morris and Cory Asbury. You can also follow Lana on <a href=#>Instagram</a> and <a href=#>TikTok</a>.</p><p>Let us know what you feel about this article</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Screen-Shot-2021-11-29-at-1.19.jpg alt="Meghan Trainor Releases “My Kind of Present” Video Starring Her Son, Husband" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/talentrecap.com/wp-content/themes/talentrecap-recap/assets/images/next_post_article_arrow.svg alt=Next style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskaGyr8DRnpqaqF6YvK57zJ6crWWknbJuws6imp5lkafBqr%2FTZqOappFiwKS7061krZ2RonqjuMCknKxlk6GutL%2FInGScp6WjwbPFjKyrmqpf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogR - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
