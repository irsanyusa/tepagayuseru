The film made more money in the box office in its debut weekend than any other movie in history, and its <a href=# rel=noopener>opening day</a> was the highest grossing of all time. Then in 2019, Marvel Studios re-released Endgame in theaters with several extra <a href=#>minutes of footage</a> to boost this effort, bringing the movie’s total to $2.79 billion. James Cameron’s 2009 film Avatar has raked in $2.788 billion.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But after the pandemic, it was unclear whether Marvel Studios would ever be able to achieve an Endgame-level box office haul again. Disney’s strategy to release Black Widow simultaneously in theaters and on its streaming service Disney+ may have depressed the gross for that film. (<a href=#>Johansson ultimately sued Disney</a> over the decision; the two parties eventually reached a settlement.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Disney has since returned to releasing its big blockbusters exclusively in theaters, though the window between the time a movie debuts in cinemas and pops up on streaming services has shrunk. Nonetheless, <a href=#>Spider-Man: No Way Home</a> became the first true box office hit of the pandemic, scoring an astounding $1.89 billion at the global box office. It’s the third-highest grossing <a href=#>Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)</a> movie ever, trailing only Avengers: Endgame and Avengers: Infinity War.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Ranked in order of international grosses, from lowest the highest, here’s how much money each Marvel movie in the MCU made in the U.S. and worldwide.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">28.

At the time, Evans was relatively unknown. His biggest role had been in another superhero franchise: the middling Fantastic Four movies. But Evans eventually grew into his movie star status, and Marvel Studios reaped the benefits: Each subsequent Captain America <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">doubled the previous film’s gross</a>.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">26.

Though the movie <a href=#>introduced Florence Pugh as Yelena</a>, likely the new Black Widow, it didn’t perform particularly well at the box office.

Zhao, a director known for realism and casting non-actors in her films, was tasked with helming a CGI-epic filled with movie stars like Angelina Jolie, Selma Hayek, and Kumail Nanjiani. The movie’s slow and contemplative pace divided fans and <a href=# rel=noopener>earned the MCU’s first and only rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes,</a> likely adversely affecting its box office success.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">24.

Though the movie performed well in many countries, <a href=# rel=noopener>Marvel Studios never got clearance to release the film in China</a>. Given that the film was produced with the Chinese moviegoing audience in mind—much of the dialogue is in Mandarin, and the cast includes some of Asian cinema’s biggest names, like Michelle Yeoh and <a href=#>Tony Leung</a>—China’s decision to block the film’s release negatively impacted its box office numbers.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">23.

The comedy-caper proved that Marvel could vary its formula a bit, though concerns about director turnover—<a href=# rel=noopener>Peyton Reed replaced Edgar Wright on the film</a>—might have depressed its movie ticket sales.

(At the time, Iron Man did not have nearly as much name recognition as Spider-Man or the X-Men characters that Marvel Studios no longer owned.) Despite its success, it was not the best performing film of 2008: Another superhero masterpiece, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Dark Knight,</a> became the top movie of that year.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">20.

The Wasp, Scott Lang’s love interest Hope Van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), joins him in an urgent mission to save her mother (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Pfeiffer</a>). Laurence Fishburne and Michael Douglas, who appear in supporting roles, also gave the movie a powerful dose of star power that helped boost its box office sales above those of the original Ant-Man.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">19.

Considering how little name recognition Doctor Strange had before this film’s release—and the comic book character’s strange, <a href=# rel=noopener>psychedelic origins</a>—the fact that it was a relative hit at the box office is actually quite impressive.

The answer, it seems, is yes: Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was perhaps the first Marvel film to require homework.
